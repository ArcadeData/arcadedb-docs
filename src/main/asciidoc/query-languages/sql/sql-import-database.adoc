==== SQL - `IMPORT DATABASE`
image:../images/edit.png[link="https://github.com/ArcadeData/arcadedb-docs/blob/main/src/main/asciidoc/query-languages/sql/sql-import-database.adoc" float=right]

Executes an import of the database into the current one. Usually an import database is executed on an empty database, but it is
possible to execute on any database. In case of conflict (unique index key already existent, etc.), the conflicting records will not
be imported. The importer automatically recognize the file between the following formats:

* *OrientDB* database export
* *Neo4J* database export
* *GraphML* database export. This format does not support complex types, like collection of elements. Using GraphSON instead of
 GraphML is recommended
* *GraphSON* database export
* *JSON* documents or responses
* *JSON Lines* documents or responses

*Syntax*

[source,sql]
----
IMPORT DATABASE <url> [WITH ( <setting-name> = <setting-value> [,] )* ]
----

* *`&lt;url&gt;`* Defines the location of the file to import. Use:
 ** `file://` as prefix for files located on the same file system where ArcadeDB is running.
 ** `https://` and `http://` as prefix for remote files.

*Examples*

* Import the public OpenBeer database available as demo database for OrientDB and exported in TGZ file
[source,shell]
----
IMPORT DATABASE https://github.com/ArcadeData/arcadedb-datasets/raw/main/orientdb/OpenBeer.gz
----

* Import the Movie database used in Neo4j's examples:
[source,shell]
----
IMPORT DATABASE https://github.com/ArcadeData/arcadedb-datasets/raw/main/neo4j/movies.graphson.tgz
----

* Import a JSON response into document type `mytype`
[source,shell]
----
IMPORT DATABASE http://echo.jsontest.com/key/value/one/two WITH documentType = 'mytype'
----

* Test data source
[source,shell]
----
IMPORT DATABASE http://echo.jsontest.com/key/value/one/two WITH probeOnly = true
----

* Import a graph from CSV, with vertices in a `vertices.csv` which contains a column `Id`,
  and edges in a `edges.csv` which contains columns `From` and `To`,
  both placed in the ArcadeDB base folder:
[source,shell]
----
IMPORT DATABASE file://empty.csv WITH vertices="file://vertices.csv", verticesFileType=csv, typeIdProperty=Id, typeIdType=Long, edges="file://edges.csv", edgesFileType=csv, edgeFromField="From", edgeToField="To"
----
