image:../images/edit.png[link="https://github.com/ArcadeData/arcadedb-docs/blob/main/src/main/asciidoc/sql/sql-alter-type.adoc" float=right]

Changes the type settings.

*Syntax*

[source,sql]
----
ALTER TYPE <type> <attribute-name> <attribute-value>
----

Where:

* *`&lt;type&gt;`* Defines the name of the type you want to edit.
* *`&lt;attribute-name&gt;`* Defines the name of attribute to change.
* *`&lt;attribute-value&gt;`* Defines the value to set.

*Attributes*

This command supports the following attributes:

* `bucketSelectionStrategy`: Defines the strategy to determine the bucket for new records.

** *`round-robin`*: Writes records to buckets in a round-robin fashion. This is useful when the main objective is distributing writes across buckets.
** *`thread`*: Assigns buckets based on the partition (mod) from the current thread ID. This provides better performance on multi-threaded applications.
** *`partitioned(<field>)`*: Assigns buckets based on the hash of the record's field.

*Examples*

* Configure the bucket selection strategy for `Account` to writing in round-robin:

```java
ArcadeDB> ALTER TYPE Account bucketSelectionStrategy round-robin
```

* Configure `Product` to partition new records based on the hash of the primary key:

```java
ArcadeDB> ALTER TYPE Product bucketSelectionStrategy "partitioned(id)"
```
