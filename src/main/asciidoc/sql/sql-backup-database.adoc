Executes a backup of the current database. The resulting file is a compressed archive using ZIP as algorithm. The archive contains
the database directory without the transaction logs. The backup is executed taking a snapshot of the database at the time the
command is executed. Any pending transaction will not be in the backup archive. ArcadeDB allows to execute a non-stop backup of a
database while it is used without blocking writes or affecting performance.

*Syntax*

[source,sql]
----
BACKUP DATABASE [ <backup-file-url> ]

----

* *`&lt;backup-file-url&gt;`* Optional, defines the location for the backup archive. If not specified, the backup file will
 be `backups/&lt;db-name&gt;/&lt;db-name&gt;-backup-&lt;timestamp&gt;.tgz`, where the timestamp is expresses from the year to the millisecond.
 Example of backup file name `backups/TheMatrix/TheMatrix-backup-20210921-172750767.zip`.

*Examples*
