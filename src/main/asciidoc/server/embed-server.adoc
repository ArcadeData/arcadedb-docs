=== Embed a Server

Embedding the server in your JVM allows to have all the benefits of working in embedded mode with ArcadeDB (zero cost for network transport and marshalling) and still having the database accessible from the outside, such as Studio, remote API, Postgres, REDIS and MongoDB drivers.

First, add the server library in your classpath. If you're using Maven include this dependency in your `pom.xml` file.

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.arcadedb</groupId>
    <artifactId>arcadedb-engine</artifactId>
    <version>21.10.1</version>
</dependency>
```

This library depends on `arcadedb-network-<version>.jar`. If you're using Maven or Gradle it will be imported automatically as a dependency, otherwise please add also the `arcadedb-network` library to your classpath.

==== Start the server in the JVM

To start a server as embedded, create it with an empty configuration, so all the setting will be the default ones:

```java
ContextConfiguration config = new ContextConfiguration();
ArcadeDBServer server = new ArcadeDBServer(config);
server.start();
```

To start a server in distributed configuration (with replicas), you can set your settings in the `ContextConfiguration`:

```java
config.setValue(GlobalConfiguration.HA_SERVER_LIST, "localhost,192.168.10.1,192.168.10.2");
config.setValue(GlobalConfiguration.HA_REPLICATION_INCOMING_HOST, "0.0.0.0");
config.setValue(GlobalConfiguration.HA_ENABLED, true);
```

When you embed the server, you should always get the database instance from the server itself. This assures the database instance is just one in the entire JVM. If you try to create or open another database instance from the `DatabaseFactory`, you will receive an error that the underlying database is locked by another process.

```java
Database database = server.getDatabase(<URL>);
```

Or this if you want to create a new database if not exists:

```java
Database database = server.getDatabase(<URL>, true);
```
