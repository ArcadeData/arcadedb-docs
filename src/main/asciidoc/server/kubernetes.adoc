=== Kubernetes (k8s)

To run a cluster of ArcadeDB Servers with Kubernetes, type this:

```
~/arcadedb $ kubectl apply -f config/arcadedb-statefulset.yaml
```

In order to scale up or down with the number of replicas, use this:

```
kubectl scale statefulse
```

Where the value of `<new-number-of-replicas>` is the new number of replicas. Example:

```
kubectl scale statefulsets arcadedb-server --replicas=3
```

Scaling up and down doesn't affect current workload. There are no pauses when a server enters/exits from the cluster.

More coming soon.
