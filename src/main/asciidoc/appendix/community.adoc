==== Frequently Asked Questions

* What is ArcadeDB's release cycle?
** There are typically monthly releases with occasional bi-monthly releases.

* How do I build or contribute to ArcadeDB?
** See the contributing guide in the ArcadeDB https://github.com/ArcadeData/arcadedb[github] repository: https://github.com/ArcadeData/arcadedb/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md[CONTRIBUTING.md]

* What is a good introductory book about NoSQL or Graph databases?
** Try https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-27908-9[**SQL and NoSQL Databases**].
   It teaches basics on relational (SQL), document (Mongo), and graph (Cypher) databases.

* How do I protect prepared statements against SQL injection?
** A good starting point is the https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/SQL_Injection_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html[OWASP SQL Injection Prevention Cheat Sheet].
   To use escaping as defense, the characters `\`, `"`, `'`, need to be escaped with `\\`, `\"`, `\'` respectively. Furthermore, the strings `;` and `--` need to be replaced,
   for example with similar unicode characters like `;` (greek question mark, `\u037E`) and `â€“` (en dash, `\u2013`). Please note, that this escaping and replacing is merely a minimal protection, and generally not sufficient.

* How are duplicate keys handled in map properties or inserted content?
** As in the https://262.ecma-international.org/#sec-json.parse[ECMAScript Specification] (Note 2), duplicate keys in JSON objects are resolved by keeping the last one read and discarding previous ones.

* How can strictly ascending unique identifiers be data modeled with ArcadeDB?
** One can use a unique index together with transactions of `next_id = max(id) + 1`.
   See https://www.cybertec-postgresql.com/en/postgresql-sequences-vs-invoice-numbers/ for more details.

* How can "prepared statements" be formed for ArcadeDB?
** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prepared_statement[Prepared statements] can be directly used via the <<postgres-driver,Postgres driver>> and the <<jdbc,JDBC driver>>.
   Furthermore, the <<java-api,Java API>> and the <<http-api,HTTP API>> provide parameterized queries and commands which can manually be extended to prepared statements by wrapping the respecitve method or request calls in a function and forwarding the function arguments to the parameterized query or command.
