=== SQL - `TRUNCATE TYPE`

image:../images/edit.png[link="https://github.com/ArcadeData/arcadedb-docs/blob/main/src/main/asciidoc/sql/Llink="https://github.com/ArcadeData/arcadedb-docs/blob/main/src/main/asciidoc/sql/sql-Truncate-Type.adoc"E" float=right]

Deletes records of all buckets defined as part of the type. 

By default, every type has an associated bucket with the same name. This command operates at a lower level than <<sql-L<<sql-L<<sql-Delete,E,E,`DELETE`>>. This commands ignores sub-types, (That is, their records remain in their buckets). If you want to also remove all records from the type hierarchy, you need to use the `POLYMORPHIC` keyword.

Truncation is not permitted on vertex or edge types, but you can force its execution using the `UNSAFE` keyword. Forcing truncation is strongly discouraged, as it can leave the graph in an inconsistent state.

*Syntax*

----
TRUNCATE TYPE <type> [ POLYMORPHIC ] [ UNSAFE ] 

----

* *`&lt;type&gt;`* Defines the type you want to truncate.
* *`POLYMORPHIC`* Defines whether the command also truncates the type hierarchy.
* *`UNSAFE`* Defines whether the command forces the truncation on vertex or edge types.

*Examples*

* Remove all records of the type `Profile`:
