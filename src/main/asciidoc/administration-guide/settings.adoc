=== Changing Settings
image:../images/edit.png[link="https://github.com/ArcadeData/arcadedb-docs/blob/main/src/main/asciidoc/administration-guide/settings.adoc" float="right"]

To change the default value of a setting, always put `arcadedb.` as a prefix. Example:

[source,shell]
----
$ java -Darcadedb.dumpConfigAtStartup=true ...
----

To change the same setting via Java code:

[source,java]
----
GlobalConfiguration.findByKey("arcadedb.dumpConfigAtStartup").setValue(true);
----

Check the <<settings-sql,Appendix>> for all the available settings.

==== Environment Variables

The server script parses a set of environment variables which are summarized below:

[cols="h,1",width=50%]
|===
| `JAVA_HOME`            | JVM location
| `JAVA_OPTS`            | JVM options
| `ARCADEDB_HOME`        | ArcadeDB location
| `ARCADEDB_PID`         | `arcadedb.pid` file location
| `ARCADEDB_OPTS_MEMORY` | JVM memory options
|===

For default values see the https://github.com/ArcadeData/arcadedb/blob/main/package/src/main/scripts/server.sh[`server.sh`] and https://github.com/ArcadeData/arcadedb/blob/main/package/src/main/scripts/server.bat[`server.bat`] scripts.

[[ram-config]]
==== RAM Configuration

The ArcadeDB server, by default, uses a dynamic allocation for the used RAM. Sometimes you want to limit this to a specific amount. You can define the environment variable `ARCADEDB_OPTS_MEMORY` to tune the JVM settings for the usage of the RAM.

Example to use 800M fixed RAM for ArcadeDB server:


[source,shell]
----
$ export ARCADEDB_OPTS_MEMORY="-Xms800M -Xmx800M"
$ bin/server.sh
----

ArcadeDB can run with as little as 16M for RAM. In case you're running ArcadeDB with less than 800M of RAM, you should set the "low-ram" as profile:

[source,shell]
----
$ export ARCADEDB_OPTS_MEMORY="-Xms128M -Xmx128M"
$ bin/server.sh -Darcadedb.profile=low-ram
----

Setting a profile is like executing a macro that changes multiple settings at once. You can tune them individually, check <<settings-sql,Settings>>.

In case of memory latency problems under Linux systems, the following JVM setting can improve performance:

[source,shell]
----
$ export ARCADEDB_OPTS_MEMORY="-XX:+PerfDisableSharedMem"
----

for more information, see https://www.evanjones.ca/jvm-mmap-pause.html

The Java heap memory is by default configured for desktop use;
for custom containers, memory configuration can be adapted by:

[source,shell]
----
$ export ARCADEDB_OPTS_MEMORY="-XX:InitialRAMPercentage=50.0 -XX:MaxRAMPercentage=75.0"
----
