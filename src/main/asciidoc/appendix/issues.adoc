Very often when a new issue is open it lacks some fundamental information. This slows down the entire process because the first question from the ArcadeDB team is always "What release of ArcadeDB are you using?" and every time a Ferret dies in the world.

So please add more information about your issue:

1. ArcadeDB **release**? (If you're using a SNAPSHOT please attach also the build number found in "build.number" file)
2. What **steps** will reproduce the problem?
1.
2.
3.
3. **Settings**. If you're using custom settings please provide them below (to dump all the settings run the application using the JVM argument -Darcadedb.environment.dumpCfgAtStartup=true)
4. What is the **expected behavior** or output? What do you get or see instead?
5. If you're describing a performance or memory problem the **profiler** dump can be very useful

Now you're ready to create a new issue on https://github.com/arcadedata/arcadedb/issues/new[GitHub].
