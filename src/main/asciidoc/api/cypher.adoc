ArcadeDB supports Open Cypher as query engine, but it doesn't support the Neo4j's BOLT protocol.
This means you can't use a Neo4J driver with ArcadeDB server.

To use Cypher queries you can do directly from the <<Java-API,Java API>> or by using the <<Postgres-Driver,Postgres driver>>.

====== Cypher from Java API

In order to execute a Cypher query, you need to include the relevant jars in your class path.
To execute a Cypher query, use "cypher" as first parameter in the query method.
Example:

[source,java]
----
ResultSet result = database.query("cypher", "MATCH (p:Person) WHERE p.age >= $p1 RETURN p.name, p.age ORDER BY p.age", "p1", 25);
----

You can use ArcadeDB's <<RID,RecordIDs (RID)>> in a cypher query to start from a specific vertex.
RIDs in Cypher are always strings, therefore they must always be contained between single or double quotes.
Example of returning the graph connected to the vertex with RID `#1:0`:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (m:Movie)<-[a:ACTED_IN]-(p:Person) WHERE id(m) = '#1:0' RETURN *
----

[discrete]
====== Cypher through Postgres Driver

You can execute a Cypher query against ArcadeDB server by using the <<Postgres-Driver,Postgres driver>> and prefixing the query with `{cypher}`.
Example:

[source,cypher]
----
"{cypher} MATCH (p:Person) WHERE p.age >= 25 RETURN p.name, p.age ORDER BY p.age"
----

ArcadeDB server will execute the query `MATCH (p:Person) WHERE p.age >= 25 RETURN p.name, p.age ORDER BY p.age` using the Cypher query language.

[discrete]
====== Cypher through HTTP/JSON

You can execute a Cypher query against ArcadeDB server by using <<HTTP-API,HTTP/JSON>> API.
Example of executing an idempotent query with HTTP GET command:

[source,shell]
----
curl "http://localhost:2480/query/graph/cypher/MATCH (p:Person) WHERE p.age >= 25 RETURN p.name, p.age ORDER BY p.age"
----

Example of executing a non-idempotent query (updates the database):

[source,shell]
----
curl -X POST "http://localhost:2480/command/graph" -d "{'language': 'cypher', 'command': 'MATCH (p:Person) WHERE p.age >= 25 RETURN p.name, p.age ORDER BY p.age'}"
----
