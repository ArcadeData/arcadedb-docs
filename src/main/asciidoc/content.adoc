* <<quick-start-docker,Run ArcadeDB with Open Beer demo database in 30 seconds>>
* What is <<multi-model,Multi-Model>>?
* ArcadeDB supports the following models:
** <<graph-model,Graph>> (compatible with Gremlin and OrientDB SQL)
** <<document-model,Document>> (compatible with the MongoDB driver and MongoDB queries)
** <<keyvalue-model,Key/Value>> (compatible with the Redis driver)
** <<searchengine-model,Search Engine>> (LSM-Tree Full-Text Index)
** <<timeseries-model,Time Series>> (under construction)
** <<vector-model,Vector>> (based on the HNSW index)

* ArcadeDB understands multiple languages, with a SQL dialect as native database query language:
** <<sql,SQL>> (inspired from OrientDB SQL dialect that supports pattern matching on graphs)
** <<open-cypher,Cypher>>
** <<gremlin-api,Apache Gremlin (Apache Tinkerpop)>>
** <<mongodb-query-language,MongoDB Query Language>>

* ArcadeDB can be used as:
** <<embedded-server,Embedded>> from any language on top of the Java Virtual Machine
** Remotely by using <<http-json-api,HTTP/JSON>>
** Remotely by using a <<postgres-driver,Postgres driver>> (ArcadeDB implements Postgres Wire protocol)
** Remotely by using a <<mongodb-query-language,MongoDB driver>> (only a subset of the operations are implemented)
** Remotely by using a <<redis-query-language,Redis driver>> (only a subset of the operations are implemented)
