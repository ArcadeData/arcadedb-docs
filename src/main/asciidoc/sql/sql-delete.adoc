image:../images/edit.png[link="https://github.com/ArcadeData/arcadedb-docs/blob/main/src/main/asciidoc/sql/Llink="https://github.com/ArcadeData/arcadedb-docs/blob/main/src/main/asciidoc/sql/Llink="https://github.com/ArcadeData/arcadedb-docs/blob/main/src/main/asciidoc/sql/sql-Delete.adoc"E"E" float=right]

Removes one or more records from the database.
You can refine the set of records that it removes using the <<Filtering,`WHERE`>> clause.

*Syntax:*

[source,sql]
----
DELETE FROM <Type>|BUCKET:<bucket>|INDEX:<index> [RETURN <returning>]
  [WHERE <Condition>*] [LIMIT <MaxRecords>] [TIMEOUT <MilliSeconds>] [UNSAFE]

----

* *`RETURN`* Defines what values the database returns.
It takes one of the following values:
** `COUNT` Returns the number of deleted records.
This is the default option.
** `BEFORE` Returns the number of records before the removal.
* *<<Filtering,`WHERE`>>* Filters to the records you want to delete.
* *`LIMIT`* Defines the maximum number of records to delete.
* *`TIMEOUT`* Defines the time period to allow the operation to run, before it times out.
* *`UNSAFE`* no use, is kept only for compatibility with OrientDB SQL and it could be removed in the future versions of the SQL language.

*Examples:*

* Delete all records with the surname `unknown`, ignoring case:

[source,sql]
----
ArcadeDB> DELETE FROM Profile WHERE surname.toLowerCase() = 'unknown'
----

* Delete all records of the type `Document`, due to an improper JSON import, or record creation command (note the use of the backticks):

[source,sql]
----
ArcadeDB> DELETE FROM `Document`
----
