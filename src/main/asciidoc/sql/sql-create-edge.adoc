=== SQL - `CREATE EDGE`

image:../images/edit.png[link="https://github.com/ArcadeData/arcadedb-docs/blob/main/src/main/asciidoc/sql/sql-create-edge.adoc" float=right]

Creates a new edge between vertexes in the database.
An edge can connect from and to a vertex record, an array of vertex records, or a query result of vertex records.

*Syntax*

[source,sql]
----
CREATE EDGE <type> [BUCKET <bucket>] FROM <rid>|[<rid>[,]*]|(<query>) TO <rid>|[<rid>[,]*]|(<query>)
                   [UNIDIRECTIONAL]
                   [IF NOT EXISTS]
                   [SET <field> = <expression>[,]*]|CONTENT {<JSON>}
                   [RETRY <retry> [WAIT <pauseBetweenRetriesInMs]]
                   [BATCH <batch-size>]
----

* *`&lt;type&gt;`* defines the type name for the edge.
* *`&lt;bucket&gt;`* defines the bucket in which you want to store the edge.
* *`UNIDIRECTIONAL`* creates a unidirectional edge; by default edges are bidirectional. 
* *`IF NOT EXISTS`* skips the creation of the edge if another edge already exists with the same direction (same from/to) and same edge type.
* *`JSON`* provides JSON content to set as the record. Use this instead of entering data field by field.
* *`RETRY`* defines the number of retries to attempt in the event of conflict (optimistic approach).
* *`WAIT`* defines the time to delay between retries in milliseconds.
* *`BATCH`* defines whether it breaks the command down into smaller blocks and the size of the batches. This helps to avoid memory issues when the number of vertices is too high. By default, it is set to `100`.

Edges and Vertices form the main components of a Graph database. ArcadeDB supports polymorphism on edges.

When no edges fail to create, ArcadeDB throws a `CommandExecutionException` error.
This makes it easier to integrate edge creation in transactions.
In such cases, if the source or target vertices don't exist, it rolls back the transaction. 

*Examples*

* Create a new edge type and an edge of the new type:

----
ArcadeDB> CREATE EDGE TYPE E1
ArcadeDB> CREATE EDGE E1 FROM #10:3 TO #11:4
----

* Create an edge in a specific bucket:

----
ArcadeDB> CREATE EDGE E1 BUCKET EuropeEdges FROM #10:3 TO #11:4
----

* Create an edge and define its properties:

----
ArcadeDB> CREATE EDGE FROM #10:3 TO #11:4 SET brand = 'fiat'
----

* Create an edge of the type `E1` and define its properties:

----
ArcadeDB> CREATE EDGE E1 FROM #10:3 TO #11:4 SET brand = 'fiat', name = 'wow'
----

* Create multiple edges from a single source vertex to many destination records:

----
ArcadeDB> CREATE EDGE E FROM #1:0 TO [#4:0, #7:0];
----

* Create edges of the type `Watched` between all action movies in the database and the user Luca, using sub-queries:

----
ArcadeDB> CREATE EDGE Watched FROM (SELECT FROM account WHERE name = 'Luca') TO 
            (SELECT FROM movies WHERE type.name = 'action')
----

* Create an edge using JSON content:

----
ArcadeDB> CREATE EDGE E FROM #22:33 TO #22:55 CONTENT { "name": "Jay", 
            "surname": "Miner" }
----

* Create an edge only if not previously created:

----
ArcadeDB> CREATE INDEX Watched_out_in ON Watched (`@out`, `@in`) UNIQUE  
ArcadeDB> CREATE EDGE Watched FROM (SELECT FROM account WHERE name = 'Luca') TO 
            (SELECT FROM movies WHERE type.name = 'action') IF NOT EXISTS
