=== SQL - `SELECT`

image:../images/edit.png[link="https://github.com/ArcadeData/arcadedb-docs/blob/main/src/main/asciidoc/sql/SQL-Select.adoc" float=right]

ArcadeDB supports the SQL language to execute queries against the database engine. For more information,
see <<Filtering,operators>> and <<SQL-Functions,functions>>. For more information on the differences between this
implementation and the SQL-92 standard, please refer to <<SQL-Introduction,this>> section.

*Syntax*:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT [ <Projections> ] [ FROM <Target> [ LET <Assignment>* ] ]
    [ WHERE <Condition>* ]
    [ GROUP BY <Field>* ]
    [ ORDER BY <Fields>* [ ASC|DESC ] * ]
    [ UNWIND <Field>* ]
    [ SKIP <SkipRecords> ]
    [ LIMIT <MaxRecords> ]
    [ TIMEOUT <MilliSeconds> [ <STRATEGY> ] ]

----

* *<<SQL-Projections,`Projections`>>* Indicates the data you want to extract from the query as the result-set. Note: In
 ArcadeDB, this variable is optional. In the projections you can define aliases for single fields, using the `AS` keyword; in
 current release aliases cannot be used in the WHERE condition, GROUP BY and ORDER BY (they will be evaluated to null)
* *`FROM`* Designates the object to query. This can be a type, bucket, single <<RID,RID>>, set of <<RID,RID>> index values sorted
 by ascending or descending key order.
** When querying a type, for `&lt;target&gt;` use the type name.
** When querying a bucket, for `&lt;target&gt;` use `BUCKET:&lt;bucket-name&gt;` (eg. `BUCKET:person`) or `BUCKET:&lt;bucket-id&gt;` (
 eg. `BUCKET:12`). This causes the query to execute only on records in that bucket.
** When querying record ID's, you can specific one or a small set of records to query. This is useful when you need to specify a
 starting point in navigating graphs.
** To query the schema you can use:
*** - `select from schema:types` to retrieve the defined types
*** - `select from schema:indexes` to retrieve the defined indexes
*** - `select from schema:database` to retrieve information about database settings
** When querying indexes, use the following prefixes:
*** `INDEXVALUES:&lt;index&gt;` and `INDEXVALUESASC:&lt;index&gt;` sorts values into an ascending order of index keys.
*** `INDEXVALUESDESC:&lt;index&gt;` sorts the values into a descending order of index keys.
* *<<Filtering,`WHERE`>>* Designates conditions to filter the result-set.
* *<<SQL-LET,`LET`>>* Binds context variables to use in projections, conditions or sub-queries.
* *`GROUP BY`* Designates field on which to group the result-set.
* *`ORDER BY`* Designates the field with which to order the result-set. Use the optional `ASC` and `DESC` operators to define the
 direction of the order. The default is ascending. Additionally, if you are using a <<SQL-Projections,projection>>, you
 need to include the `ORDER BY` field in the projection. Note that ORDER BY works only on projection fields (fields that are
 returned to the result set) not on LET variables.
* *<<SQL-Select-Unwind,`UNWIND`>>* Designates the field on which to unwind the collection.
* *`SKIP`* Defines the number of records you want to skip from the start of the result-set. You may find this useful in <<SQL-Pagination,Pagination>>, when using it in conjunction with `LIMIT`.
* *`LIMIT`* Defines the maximum number of records in the result-set. You may find this useful in <<SQL-Pagination,Pagination>>, when using it in conjunction with `SKIP`.
* *`TIMEOUT`* Defines the maximum time in milliseconds for the query. By default, queries have no timeouts. If you don't specify a
 timeout strategy, it defaults to `EXCEPTION`. These are the available timeout strategies:
** `RETURN` Truncate the result-set, returning the data collected up to the timeout.
** `EXCEPTION` Raises an exception.

*Examples*

* Return all records of the type `Person`, where the name starts with `Luk`:
[source,sql]
----
ArcadeDB> SELECT FROM Person WHERE name LIKE 'Luk%'
----

Alternatively, you might also use either of these queries:

[source,sql]
----
ArcadeDB> SELECT FROM Person WHERE name.left(3) = 'Luk'
ArcadeDB> SELECT FROM Person WHERE name.substring(0,3) = 'Luk'
----

* Return all records of the type `!AnimalType` where the collection `races` contains at least one entry where the first character
 is `e`, ignoring case:
[source,sql]
----
ArcadeDB> SELECT FROM animaltype WHERE races CONTAINS( name.toLowerCase().subString(
            0, 1) = 'e' )
----

* Return all records of type `!AnimalType` where the collection `races` contains at least one entry with names `European`
 or `Asiatic`:
[source,sql]
----
ArcadeDB> SELECT * FROM animaltype WHERE races CONTAINS(name in ['European',
            'Asiatic'])
----

* Return all records in the type `Profile` where any field contains the word `danger`:
[source,sql]
----
ArcadeDB> SELECT FROM Profile WHERE ANY() LIKE '%danger%'
----

* Return any record where up to the third level of connections has some field that contains the word `danger`, ignoring case:
[source,sql]
----
ArcadeDB> SELECT FROM Profile WHERE ANY() TRAVERSE(0, 3) ( 
            ANY().toUpperCase().indexOf('danger') > -1 )
----

* Return all results on type `Profile`, ordered by the field `name` in descending order:
[source,sql]
----
ArcadeDB> SELECT FROM Profile ORDER BY name DESC
----

* Return the number of records in the type `Account` per city:
[source,sql]
----
ArcadeDB> SELECT SUM(*) FROM Account GROUP BY city
----

* Traverse records from a root node:
[source,sql]
----
ArcadeDB> SELECT FROM #11:4 WHERE ANY() TRAVERSE(0,10) (address.city = 'Rome')
----

* Return only a limited set of records:
[source,sql]
----
ArcadeDB> SELECT FROM [#10:3, #10:4, #10:5]
----

* Return three fields from the type `Profile`:
[source,sql]
----
ArcadeDB> SELECT nick, followings, followers FROM Profile
----

* Return the field `name` in uppercase and the field country name of the linked city of the address:
[source,sql]
----
ArcadeDB> SELECT name.toUppercase(), address.city.country.name FROM Profile
----

* Return records from the type `Profile` in descending order of their creation:
[source,sql]
----
ArcadeDB> SELECT FROM Profile ORDER BY @rid DESC
----

* Return value of `email` which is stored in a JSON field `data` (type EMBEDDED) of the type `Person`, where the name starts
 with `Luk`:
[source,sql]
----
ArcadeDB> SELECT data.email FROM Person WHERE name LIKE 'Luk%'
----

ArcadeDB can open an inverse cursor against buckets. This is very fast and doesn't require the typical ordering resources, CPU and
RAM.

**Projections **

In the standard implementations of SQL, projections are mandatory. In ArcadeDB, the omission of projects translates to its returning
the entire record. That is, it reads no projection as the equivalent of the `*` wildcard.

[source,sql]
----
ArcadeDB> SELECT FROM Account
----

For all projections except the wildcard `*`, it creates a new temporary document, which does not include the `@rid`
fields of the original record.

[source,sql]
----
ArcadeDB> SELECT name, age FROM Account
----

The naming convention for the returned document fields are:

* Field name for plain fields, like `invoice` becoming `invoice`.
* First field name for chained fields, like `invoice.customer.name` becoming `invoice`.
* Function name for functions, like `MAX(salary)` becoming `max`.

In the event that the target field exists, it uses a numeric progression. For instance,

[source,sql]
----
ArcadeDB> SELECT MAX(incoming), MAX(cost) FROM Balance

------+------
 max  | max2
------+------
 1342 | 2478
------+------
----

To override the display for the field names, use the `AS`.

[source,sql]
----
ArcadeDB> SELECT MAX(incoming) AS max_incoming, MAX(cost) AS max_cost FROM Balance

---------------+----------
 max_incoming  | max_cost
---------------+----------
 1342          | 2478
---------------+----------
----

With the dollar sign `$`, you can access the context variables. Each time you run the command, ArcadeDB accesses the context to read
and write the variables. For instance, say you want to display the path and depth levels up to the fifth of a
<<SQL-Traverse,`TRAVERSE`>> on all records in the `Movie` type.

[source,sql]
----
ArcadeDB> SELECT $path, $depth FROM ( TRAVERSE * FROM Movie WHERE $depth <= 5 )
----

[[SQL-LET]]
==== `LET` Block

The `LET` block contains context variables to assign each time ArcadeDB evaluates a record. It destroys these values once the query
execution ends. You can use context variables in projections, conditions, and sub-queries.

**Assigning Fields for Reuse **

ArcadeDB allows for crossing relationships. In single queries, you need to evaluate the same branch of the nested relationship. This
is better than using a context variable that refers to the full relationship.

[source,sql]
----
ArcadeDB> SELECT FROM Profile WHERE address.city.name LIKE '%Saint%"' AND 
          ( address.city.country.name = 'Italy' OR 
            address.city.country.name = 'France' )
----

Using the `LET` makes the query shorter and faster, because it traverses the relationships only once:

[source,sql]
----
ArcadeDB> SELECT FROM Profile LET $city = address.city WHERE $city.name LIKE 
          '%Saint%"' AND ($city.country.name = 'Italy' OR $city.country.name = 'France')
----

In this case, it traverses the path till `address.city` only once.

[discrete]
==== Sub-query

The `LET` block allows you to assign a context variable to the result of a sub-query.

[source,sql]
----
ArcadeDB> SELECT FROM Document LET $temp = ( SELECT @rid, $depth FROM (TRAVERSE 
          V.OUT, E.IN FROM $parent.current ) WHERE @type = 'Concept' AND 
          ( id = 'first concept' OR id = 'second concept' )) WHERE $temp.SIZE() > 0
----

**`LET` Block in Projection **

You can use context variables as part of a result-set in <<SQL-Projections,projections>>. For instance, the query below displays the
city name from the previous example:

[source,sql]
----
ArcadeDB> SELECT $temp.name FROM Profile LET $temp = address.city WHERE $city.name 
          LIKE '%Saint%"' AND ( $city.country.name = 'Italy' OR 
          $city.country.name = 'France' )
----

[[SQL-Select-Unwind]]
[discrete]
==== Unwinding

ArcadeDB allows unwinding of collection fields and obtaining multiple records as a result, one for each element in the collection:

[source,sql]
----
ArcadeDB> SELECT name, OUT("Friend").name AS friendName FROM Person

--------+-------------------
 name   | friendName
--------+-------------------
 'John' | ['Mark', 'Steve']
--------+-------------------
----

In the event if you want one record for each element in `friendName`, you can rewrite the query using `UNWIND`:

[source,sql]
----
ArcadeDB> SELECT name, OUT("Friend").name AS friendName FROM Person UNWIND friendName

--------+-------------
 name   | friendName
--------+-------------
 'John' | 'Mark'
 'John' | 'Steve'
--------+-------------
----
