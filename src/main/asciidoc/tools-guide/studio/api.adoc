The panel uses a two-column layout:

* *Left sidebar* - Lists all available API endpoints organized by category (Health & Status, Authentication, Query Execution, Commands, Transactions, Server Management, etc.).
Each endpoint shows its HTTP method (GET/POST) with a colored badge and the URL path.
* *Right panel* - Displays detailed documentation for the selected endpoint.
