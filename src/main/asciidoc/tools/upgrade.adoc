ArcadeDB is able to automatically upgrade a database when a newer version of ArcadeDB is used.
The migration is completely automatic and transparent.

==== Steps

1. Download and extract a newer version of ArcadeDB in the local file system
2. Stop any ArcadeDB running servers (or close manually the database by using the HTTP command "<<HTTP-ServerCommand,close database>>").
3. Copy the databases directory from the old server to the new one
4. Start the new server

=== Downgrade ArcadeDB

In the case you need to downgrade to an older version of ArcadeDB, check the binary compatibility between the versions.
ArcadeDB uses the https://semver.org[semantic versioning] with 100% compatibility for migration of databases up or down between patch version (the Z in X.Y.Z). To downgrade to a minor or major, the safest way is to export the database with the newest version and re-import the database with the older version.
