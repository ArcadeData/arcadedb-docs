ArcadeDB supports Open Cypher as query engine, but it doesn't support the Neo4j's BOLT protocol.
This means you can't use a Neo4J driver with ArcadeDB server.

To use Cypher queries you can do directly from the <<Java-API,Java API>> or by using the <<Postgres-Driver,Postgres driver>>.

====== Cypher from Java API

In order to execute a Cypher query, you need to include the relevant jars in your class path.
To execute a Cypher query, use "cypher" as first \arameter in the query method.
Example:

```java
ResultSet result = database.query("cypher", "MATCH (p:Person) WHERE p.age >= $p1 RETURN p.name, p.age ORDER BY p.age", "p1", 25);
```

====== Cypher through Postgres Driver

You can execute a Cypher query against ArcadeDB server by using the <<Postgres-Driver,Postgres driver>> and prefixing the query with `{cypher}`. Example:

```cypher
"{cypher} MATCH (p:Person) WHERE p.age >= 25 RETURN p.name, p.age ORDER BY p.age"
```

ArcadeDB server will execute the query `MATCH (p:Person) WHERE p.age >= 25 RETURN p.name, p.age ORDER BY p.age` using the Cypher query language.

====== Cypher through HTTP/JSON

You can execute a Cypher query against ArcadeDB server by using <<HTTP-API,HTTP/JSON>> API. Example of executing an idempotent query with HTTP GET command:

```shell
curl "http://localhost:2480/query/graph/cypher/MATCH (p:Person) WHERE p.age >= 25 RETURN p.name, p.age ORDER BY p.age"
```

Example of executing a non-idempotent query (updates the database):

```shell
curl -X POST "http://localhost:2480/command/graph" -d "{'language': 'cypher', 'command': 'MATCH (p:Person) WHERE p.age >= 25 RETURN p.name, p.age ORDER BY p.age'}"
```
