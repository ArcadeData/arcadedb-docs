### Inheritance

Unlike many Object-relational mapping tools, ArcadeDB does not split documents between different types.
Each document resides in one or a number of buckets associated with its specific type.
When you execute a query against a type that has subtypes, OrientDB searches the buckets of the target type and all subtypes.

#### Declaring Inheritance in Schema

In developing your application, bear in mind that ArcadeDB needs to know the type inheritance relationship.
This is an abstract concept that applies to both  [POJO's](../java/Object-DB-Interface.md#inheritance) and  [Documents](../java/Document-Database.md).

For example,

[source,java]
----
DocumentType account = database.getSchema().createDocumentType("Account");
DocumentType company = database.getSchema().createDocumentType("Company").addParent(account);
----

#### Using Polymorphic Queries

By default, OrientDB treats all queries as polymorphic.
Using the example above, you can run the following query from the console:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT FROM Account WHERE name.toUpperCase() = 'GOOGLE'
----

This query returns all instances of the types `Account` and `Company` that have a property name that matches `Google`.

#### How Inheritance Works

Consider an example, where you have three types, listed here with the bucket identifier in the parentheses.

[source]
----
Account(10) <|--- Company (13) <|--- OrientTechnologiesGroup (27)
----

By default, ArcadeDB creates a separate bucket for each type.
It indicates this bucket by the `defaultBucketId` property in the type `OType` and indicates the bucket used by default when not specified.
However, the type `OType` has a property `bucketIds`, (as `int[]`), that contains all the buckets able to contain the records of that type.  `bucketIds` and `defaultBucketId` are the same by default.

When you execute a query against a type, OrientDB limits the result-sets to only the records of the buckets contained in the `bucketIds` property.
For example,

[source,sql]
----
SELECT FROM Account WHERE name.toUpperCase() = 'GOOGLE'
----

This query returns all the records with the name property set to `GOOGLE` from all three types, given that the base type `Account` was specified.
For the type `Account`, ArcadeDB searches inside the buckets `10`, `13` and `27`, following the inheritance specified in the schema.
