The universal database tool https://dbeaver.io[DBeaver] has basic compatibility via the legacy Postgres connector.
Create a new connection with the "PostgreSQL (Old)" driver:

Set the `sslmode` option to `disable`:

The "Finish" the connection wizard and double click the created connection to connect.
Then with a right-click the SQL console can be started:

Now the SQL console can be used to communicate via DBeaver with ArcadeDB.

Note that this is only a basic support using a generic relational driver for a NoSQL database,
so various functionalities can reslt in errors.
