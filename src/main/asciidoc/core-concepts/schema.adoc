ArcadeDB supports schema-less, schema-full and hybrid operation.
This means for all types that have a declared schema it is applied.
Minimally, a type (document, vertex or edge) needs to be declared in a database to be able to insert to,
i.e. <<sql-create-type,CREATE TYPE (SQL)>> and <<sql-alter-type,ALTER TYPE (SQL)>>.
Beyond the type, declaration properties with or without constraints, can be declared,
i.e. <<sql-create-property,CREATE PROPERTY (SQL)>> and <<sql-alter-property,ALTER PROPERTY (SQL)>>.
Inserting into a declared type, all datasets are accepted (even with additional undeclared properties) as long as no property constraints are violated.
