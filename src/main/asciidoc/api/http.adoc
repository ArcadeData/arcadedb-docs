==== Introduction

The ArcadeDB Server is accessible from the remote through the HTTP/JSON protocol.
The protocol is very simple.
For this reason, you don't need a driver, because every modern programming language provides an easy way to execute HTTP requests and parse JSON.

For the examples in this chapter we're going to use https://curl.se/[`curl`].
Every request must be authenticated by passing user and password as HTTP basic authentication (in HTTP Headers).
In the examples below we're going to always use "root" user with password "arcadedb-password".

NOTE: Under Windows (Powershell) single and double quotes inside a single or double quoted string
      need to be replaced with their Unicode entity representations `\u0022` (double quote) and
      `\u0027` (single quote). This is for example the case in the data argument (`-d`) of POST requests.

[discrete]
==== Server-Side Transactions

ArcadeDB implements server-side transaction over HTTP stateless protocol by using sessions.
A session is created with the <<HTTP-Begin,/begin>> command and returns a session id in the response header (example `arcadedb-session-id: AS-ee056170-dc9b-4956-8d71-d7cfa01900d4`).
Use the session id in the request header of further commands you want to execute in the same transaction and execute <<HTTP-Commit,/commit>> to commit the server side transaction or <<HTTP-Rollback,/rollback>> to rollback the changes.
After a period of inactivity (default is 30 seconds, see <<Settings,`server.httpTxExpireTimeout`>>), the server automatically rolls back and purges expired transactions.

[discrete]
==== Transaction Scripts

In case <<SQL,SQL>> (`sql`) is supposed to be used as language for a transactions,
the language variant "SQL script" (`sqlscript`) is also available.
A `sqlscript` can consist of one or multiple SQL statements,
which is collectively treated as a transaction.
Hence, for such a batch of SQL statements, no `begin` and `commit` commands are necessary,
since `begin` and `commit` implicitly enclose any `sqlscript` command.

[[WebSocket-Streaming]]
==== Streaming Change Events

IMPORTANT: This feature presently only supports single server deployments.
Cluster support is coming soon.

The Java API supports real-time change notifications, which the HTTP API implements via a websocket.
You can opt into notifications for all changes that occur on a database, or filter by the operation (i.e. create, update, delete) or underlying entity type.

To connect, point your favorite WebSocket client to the `ws://SERVER:PORT/ws` endpoint.
You will need to authenticate with HTTP Basic, which for some clients (like most browsers) is only possible via the URI, like this: `ws://USERNAME:PASSWORD@SERVER:PORT/ws`.
Others will require that you set the Authorization header directly.
Check the documentation for your client of choice for details.

To subscribe/unsubscribe to change events, send JSON messages using the following structure:

[cols="10h,10h,~",options="header"]
|===
|Property|Required|Description
|action|Required| `subscribe` or `unsubscribe`.
|database|Required| The database name.
|type|Optional| The entity type to filter by.
|changeTypes|Optional| Array of change types you'd like to receive. Must be `create`, `update`, or `delete`.
|===

Example: to subscribe to all changes (create, update, delete) for the type `Movie` in the database `movies`, use:

[source,json]
----
{"action": "subscribe", "database": "movies", "type": "Movie"}
----

If instead, you only want updates, send:

[source,json]
----
{"action": "subscribe", "database": "movies", "type": "Movie", "changeTypes": ["update"]}
----

If you want every change on the database (use with caution!):

[source,json]
----
{"action": "subscribe", "database": "movies"}
----

Once subscribed, you will get JSON messages for any matching changes with the following properties:

[cols="10h,~",options="header"]
|===
|Property|Description
|database| The source database.
|changeType| create, update or delete.
|record| The full record that generated the change event.

==== Tutorial

Let's first create an empty database "school" on the server:

[source,shell]
----
curl -X POST http://localhost:2480/api/v1/server
     -d '{ "command": "create database school" }'
     -H "Content-Type: application/json"
     --user root:arcadedb-password
----

Now let's create the type "Class":

[source,shell]
----
curl -X POST http://localhost:2480/api/v1/command/school
     -d '{ "language": "sql", "command": "create document type Class"}'
     -H "Content-Type: application/json"
     --user root:arcadedb-password
----

We could insert our first Class by using SQL:

[source,shell]
----
curl -X POST http://localhost:2480/api/v1/command/school
     -d '{ "language": "sql", "command": "insert into Class set name = '\''English'\'', location = '\''3rd floor'\''"}'
     -H "Content-Type: application/json"
     --user root:arcadedb-password
----

Or better, using parameters with SQL:

[source,shell]
----
curl -X POST http://localhost:2480/api/v1/command/school
     -d '{ "language": "sql", "command": "insert into Class set name = :name, location = :location", "params": { "name": "English", "location": "3rd floor" }}'
     -H "Content-Type: application/json"
     --user root:arcadedb-password
----

Or by using the `api/v1/document` API:

[source,shell]
----
curl -X POST http://localhost:2480/api/v1/document/school
     -d '{"@type": "Class", "name": "English", "location": "3rd floor"}'
     -H "Content-Type: application/json"
     --user root:arcadedb-password
----

URL Syntax: `/api/v1/ready`

This endpoint accepts (GET) requests without authentication,
and is useful for remote monitoring of server readiness.

Example:

[source,shell]
----
curl -X GET http://localhost:2480/api/v1/ready
----

Return:

```
HTTP/1.1 204 OK
```

===== Get server information (GET)

Returns the current configuration.

URL Syntax: `/api/v1/server`

The following `mode` query parameter values are available:

* `basic` returns minimal server information.
* `default` returns full server configuration (default value when no parameter is given).
* `cluster` returns cluster layout.

Example:

[source,shell]
----
curl -X GET http://localhost:2480/api/v1/server?mode=basic
     --user root:arcadedb-password

[discrete]
[[HTTP-OpenDatabase]]
===== Open a database (POST)

Opens a database on the server.
By default, all the databases under the `databases/` directory on the server are loaded at startup.
You can manually load the databases by setting `arcadedb.server.databaseLoadAtStartup=false` and invoking the open command on the databases you are going to use.
Also, you can open a database previously closed because of a restore database command.

URL Syntax: `/api/v1/open/{database}`

Where:

- `database` is the database name

Example of opening the database "school":

[source,shell]
----
curl -X POST http://localhost:2480/api/v1/open/school
     --user root:arcadedb-password
----

[discrete]
[[HTTP-CloseDatabase]]
===== Close a database (POST)

Closes a database on the server.
Use this command to free resources in case there are many databases managed by the server.
Also, close the database before a restore of the database.

URL Syntax: `/api/v1/close/{database}`

Where:

- `database` is the database name

Example of closing the database "school":

[source,shell]
----
curl -X POST http://localhost:2480/api/v1/close/school
     --user root:arcadedb-password
----

[discrete]
[[HTTP-ExecuteQuery]]
===== Execute a query (GET)

This command allows executing idempotent commands, like `SELECT` and `MATCH`:

URL Syntax: `/api/v1/query/{database}/{language}/{command}`

Where:

- `database` is the database name
- `language` is the query language used.
is the query language used, between "sql", "sqlscript", "graphql", "cypher", "gremlin", "mongo" and any other language supported by ArcadeDB and available at runtime.
- `command` the command to execute in encoded format

You might need to encode the URL if contains special characters and spaces.

NOTE: Due to security reasons (encoded) slashes `/` (`%2F`) which are used for divisions or block
      comments, cannot be used in queries via the `query/` endpoint.

Example:

[source,shell]
----
curl -X GET http://localhost:2480/api/v1/query/school/sql/select%20from%20Class
     --user root:arcadedb-password
----

[discrete]
[[HTTP-ExecuteCommand]]
===== Execute database command (POST)

Executes a non-idempotent command.

URL Syntax: `/api/v1/command/{database}`

Where:

- `database` is the database name

Example to create the new document type "Class":

[source,shell]
----
curl -X POST http://localhost:2480/api/v1/command/school
     -d '{ "language": "sql", "command": "create document type Class"}'
     -H "Content-Type: application/json"
     --user root:arcadedb-password
----

The payload, as a JSON, accepts the following parameters:

- `language` is the query language used, between "sql", "sqlscript", "graphql", "cypher", "gremlin", "mongo" and any other language supported by ArcadeDB and available at runtime.
- `command` the command to execute in encoded format
- `limit` (optional) is the maximum number of results to return
- `params` (optional), is the map of parameters to pass to the query engine
- `serializer` (optional) specify the serializer used for the result:
** `graph`: returns as a graph separating vertices from edges
** `record`: returns everything as records
** by default it's like record but with additional metadata for vertex records, such as the number of outgoing edges in `@out` property and total incoming edges in `@in` property.
This serialzier is used by Studio

Example of insertion of a new Client by using parameters:

[source,shell]
----
curl -X POST http://localhost:2480/api/v1/command/company
     -d '{ "language": "sql", "command": "create vertex Client set firstName = :firstName, lastName = :lastName", params: { "firstName": "Jay", "lastName", "Miner" } }'
     -H "Content-Type: application/json"
     --user root:arcadedb-password
----

[[HTTP-Begin]]
===== Begin a transaction (POST)

Begins a transaction on the server managed as a session.
The response header contains the session id.
Set this id in the following requests to execute them in the same transaction scope.
See also <<HTTP-Commit,/commit>> and <<HTTP-Rollback,/rollback>>.

URL Syntax: `/api/v1/begin/{database}`

Where:

- `database` is the database name

Example:

```
curl -X POST http://localhost:2480/api/v1/begin/school
     --user root:arcadedb-password -I
```

Returns the Session Id in the response header, example:

`arcadedb-session-id: AS-ee056170-dc9b-4956-8d71-d7cfa01900d4`

Use the session id in the request header of further commands you want to execute in the same transaction and execute <<HTTP-Commit,/commit>> to commit the server side transaction or <<HTTP-Rollback,/rollback>> to rollback the changes.
After a period of inactivity (default is 30 seconds), the server automatically rollback and purge expired transactions.

[discrete]
[[HTTP-Commit]]
===== Commit a transaction (POST)

Commits a transaction on the server.
Set the session id obtained with the <<HTTP-Begin,/begin>> command as a header of the request.
See also <<HTTP-Begin,/begin>> and <<HTTP-Rollback,/rollback>>.

URL Syntax: `/api/v1/commit/{database}`

Where:

- `database` is the database name

Set the session id returned from the <<HTTP-Begin,/begin>> command in the request header.
If the session (and therefore the server side transaction) is expired, then a 500 Internal server error is returned.

Example:

[source,shell]
----
curl -X POST http://localhost:2480/api/v1/commit/school
     -H "arcadedb-session-id: AS-ee056170-dc9b-4956-8d71-d7cfa01900d4"
     --user root:arcadedb-password
----

[discrete]
[[HTTP-Rollback]]
===== Rollback a transaction (POST)

Rollbacks a transaction on the server.
Set the session id obtained with the <<HTTP-Begin,/begin>> command as a header of the request.
See also <<HTTP-Begin,/begin>> and <<HTTP-Commit,/commit>>.

URL Syntax: `/api/v1/rollback/{database}`

Where:

- `database` is the database name

Set the session id returned from the <<HTTP-Begin,/begin>> command in the request header.
If the session (and therefore the server side transaction) is expired, then a 500 Internal server error is returned.

Example:

[source,shell]
----
curl -X POST http://localhost:2480/api/v1/rollback/school
     -H "arcadedb-session-id: AS-ee056170-dc9b-4956-8d71-d7cfa01900d4"
