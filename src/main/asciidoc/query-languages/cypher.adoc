=== Cypher

ArcadeDB partially supports Open Cypher as query engine.
It uses link:https://github.com/opencypher/cypher-for-gremlin[Cypher for Gremlin] under-the-hood which has stopped being supported a few years ago.
There are a lot of things that work and a lot of nuances which don't.

ArcadeDB also doesn't support Neo4j's BOLT protocol.
This means you can't use a Neo4J driver with ArcadeDB server.

To use Cypher queries you can do directly from the <<java-api,Java API>>, by using <<http-api,HTTP Api>> or the <<postgres-driver,Postgres driver>>.

NOTE: Consider that Cypher queries are translated into Gremlin.
As much as ArcadeDB's Gremlin implementation is optimized, queries run slower than using native SQL or Java API.
Based on some internal benchmarks, ArcadeDB's native SQL (<<sql-select,SELECT>> or <<sql-match,MATCH>>) is much faster than Cypher (even 2,000% faster!).
The difference is larger with complex queries that work on many records.
A simple Cypher MATCH with a lookup with a simple condition will be closer to native SQL performance, but a scan or huge traversal will be much slower with Cypher, because of the underlying usage of Gremlin is not optimized for extreme performance.

Some of the known limitations on using Cypher with ArcadeDB:
- limited support for large arrays: https://github.com/ArcadeData/arcadedb/issues/1792
- Unwind edge creation slow: https://github.com/ArcadeData/arcadedb/issues/1713
- Auto type conversion using MERGE with indexes: https://github.com/ArcadeData/arcadedb/issues/1301
- Cypher timestamp() not supported: https://github.com/ArcadeData/arcadedb/issues/409

==== Cypher from Java API

In order to execute a Cypher query, you need to include the relevant jars in your class path.
To execute a Cypher query, use "cypher" as first parameter in the query method.
Example:

[source,java]
----
ResultSet result = database.query("cypher", "MATCH (p:Person) WHERE p.age >= $p1 RETURN p.name, p.age ORDER BY p.age", "p1", 25);
----

You can use ArcadeDB's <<rid,RecordIDs (RID)>> in a cypher query to start from a specific vertex.
RIDs in Cypher are always strings, therefore they must always be contained between single or double quotes.
Example of returning the graph connected to the vertex with RID `#1:0`:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (m:Movie)<-[a:ACTED_IN]-(p:Person) WHERE id(m) = '#1:0' RETURN *
----

==== Cypher through Postgres Driver

You can execute a Cypher query against ArcadeDB server by using the <<postgres-driver,Postgres driver>> and prefixing the query with `{cypher}`.
Example:

[source,cypher]
----
"{cypher} MATCH (p:Person) WHERE p.age >= 25 RETURN p.name, p.age ORDER BY p.age"
----

ArcadeDB server will execute the query `MATCH (p:Person) WHERE p.age >= 25 RETURN p.name, p.age ORDER BY p.age` using the Cypher query language.

==== Cypher through HTTP/JSON

You can execute a Cypher query against ArcadeDB server by using <<http-api,HTTP/JSON>> API.
Example of executing an idempotent query with HTTP GET command:

[source,shell]
----
curl "http://localhost:2480/query/graph/cypher/MATCH (p:Person) WHERE p.age >= 25 RETURN p.name, p.age ORDER BY p.age"
----

Example of executing a non-idempotent query (updates the database):

[source,shell]
----
curl -X POST "http://localhost:2480/command/graph" -d "{'language': 'cypher', 'command': 'MATCH (p:Person) WHERE p.age >= 25 RETURN p.name, p.age ORDER BY p.age'}"
----

==== Known Limitations with the Cypher Implementation

- ArcadeDB automatically handles the conversion between compatible types, such as strings and numbers when possible. Cypher does not. So if you define a schema with the ArcadeDB API and then you use Cypher for a traversal, ensure you’re using the same type you defined in the schema. For example, if you define a property "id" to be a string, and then you’re executing traversal by using integers for the ids, the result could be unpredictable.
- ArcadeDB's Cypher implementation is based on the https://github.com/opencypher/cypher-for-gremlin[Cypher For Gremlin] Open Source transpiler. This project is not actively maintained by Open Cypher anymore, so issues in the transpiler are hard to fix. Please bear this in mind if you're moving a large project in Cypher into ArcadeDB. The best way to address such issues is to rewrite the faulty cypher query into ArcadeDB <<sql-select,SELECT>> or <<sql-match,MATCH>> statement.
