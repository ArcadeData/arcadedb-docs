ArcadeDB Server supports a subset of the https://graphql.org/[GraphQL] specification.
Please open an issue or a discussion on GitHub to increase the support for GraphQL.

If you're using ArcadeDB as <<embedded-server,embedded>>, please add the dependency to the `arcadedb-graphql` library.
If you're using Maven include this dependency in your `pom.xml` file.

[source,xml, subs="+attributes"]

<dependency>
    <groupId>com.arcadedb</groupId>
    <artifactId>arcadedb-graphql</artifactId>
    <version>{revnumber}</version>
</dependency>
----

GraphQL is supported in ArcadeDB as a query language engine.
This means you can execute a GraphQL command from:

- Java API by using the non-idempotent `.command()` and the idempotent `.query()` API by using `"graphql"` as language.
Example: `Resultset resultset = db.query("graphql", "{ bookById(id: "book-1"){ id name authors { firstName, lastName } }");`
- HTTP API by using <<http-command,`/command`>> and <<http-executequery,`/query`>> commands and `"graphql"` as language
- <<postgres-driver,Postgres Driver>> by prefixing with `{graphql}` your query to execute.
Example: `{graphql}{ bookById(id: "book-1"){ id name authors { firstName, lastName } }`

==== Type definition

GraphQL requires to define the types used.
If you're using the <<document-model,Document Model>> and links to connect documents, then you can map 1-1 the GraphQL type to ArcadeDB type.
Example:

[source,graphql]
----
type Book {
  id: ID
  name: String
  pageCount: Int
  authors: [Author]
}
----

If you're using a <<graph-model,Graph Model>> for your domain, then you need to declare with a GraphQL directive how the relationship is translated on the graph model.

In the example below, the `authors` is a collection of Author retrieved by looking at the incoming (`direction: IN`) edges of type "IS_AUTHOR_OF" (`type: "IS_AUTHOR_OF"`):

[source,graphql]
----
type Book {
  id: ID
  name: String
  pageCount: Int
  authors: [Author] @relationship(type: "IS_AUTHOR_OF", direction: IN)
}
----

NOTE: Directives can be defined on both types and queries.
Directives defined in queries override any directives defined in types, only for the query execution context.

You can define your model incrementally and apply it to the current database instance by executing a command containing the type definition.
Example by using Java API (but the same by using <<http-command,HTTP Command>> API):

[source,java]
----
String types = "type Query {" +
              "  bookById(id: ID): Book" +
              "}" +
              "type Book {" +
              "  id: ID" +
              "  name: String" +
              "  pageCount: Int" +
              "  authors: [Author] @relationship(type: \"IS_AUTHOR_OF\", direction: IN)" +
              "}" +
              "type Author {" +
              "  id: ID" +
              "  firstName: String" +
              "  lastName: String" +
              "}";

database.command("graphql", types);
----

With this example the types `Book` and `Author` are defined together with the query `bookById`.
You can add new types or replace existing types by just submitting the type(s) again.
The GraphQL module will update the current definition of types.

NOTE: This definition is not saved in the database and must be declared after the database is open, before executing any GraphQL queries.

==== Supported directives

Directives can be defined on both types and queries.
Directives defined in queries override any directives defined in types, only for the query execution context.

[discrete]
===== @relationship

Applies to: `Query Field` and `Field Definition`

Syntax: `@relationship([type: "<type-name>"] [, direction: <OUT|IN|BOTH>])`

Where:

- `type` is the edge type, optional.
If not specified, then all the types are considered
- `direction` is the direction of the edge, optional.
If not specified, then BOTH is used

Example:

[source,graphql]
----
friends: [Account] @relationship(type: "FRIEND", direction: BOTH)
----

[discrete]
[[graphql-sql]]
===== @sql

Applies to: `Query Field` and `Field Definition`

Syntax: `@sql( statement: <sql-statement> )`

Executes a <<sql,SQL>> query.
The query can use parameters passed at invocation time.

Example of definition of a query using <<sql,SQL>> in GraphQL:

[source,graphql]
----
bookByName(bookNameParameter: String): Book @sql(statement: "select from Book where name = :bookNameParameter")
----

Invoke the query defined above passing the book name as parameter:

[source,java]
----
ResultSet resultSet = database.query("graphql", "{ bookByName(bookNameParameter: \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\")}"));
----

[discrete]
===== @gremlin

Applies to: `Query Field` and `Field Definition`

Syntax: `@gremlin( statement: <gremlin-statement> )`

Executes a <<gremlin-api,Gremlin>> query.
The query can use parameters passed at invocation time.

Example of definition of a query using <<gremlin-api,Gremlin>> in GraphQL:

[source,graphql]
----
bookByName(bookNameParameter: String): Book @gremlin(statement: "g.V().has('name', bookNameParameter)")
----

Invoke the query defined above passing the book name as parameter:

[source,java]
----
ResultSet resultSet = database.query("graphql", "{ bookByName(bookNameParameter: \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\")}"));
----

[discrete]
===== @cypher

Applies to: `Query Field` and `Field Definition`

Syntax: `@cypher( statement: <cypher-statement> )`

Executes a <<open-cypher,Cypher>> query.
The query can use parameters passed at invocation time.

Example of definition of a query using <<open-cypher,Cypher>> in GraphQL:

[source,graphql]
----
bookByName(bookNameParameter: String): Book @cypher(statement: "MATCH (b:Book {name: $bookNameParameter}) RETURN b")
----

Invoke the query defined above passing the book name as parameter:

[source,java]
----
ResultSet resultSet = database.query("graphql", "{ bookByName(bookNameParameter: \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\")}"));
----

[discrete]
===== @rid

Applies to: `Query Field` and `Field Definition`

Syntax: `@rid`

Mark the field as the record identity or <<rid>>.

Example:

[source,graphql]
----
{ bookById(id: "book-1")
  {
    rid @rid
    id
    name
    authors {
      firstName
      lastName
    }
  }
}
