To start ArcadeDB as a server run the script `server.sh` under the `bin` directory of ArcadeDB distribution. If you're using MS Windows OS, replace `server.sh` with `server.bat`.

```shell
~/arcadedb $ bin/server.sh

| This is the first time the server is running. Please type a        |
| password of your choice for the 'root' user or leave it blank      |
| to auto-generate it.                                               |
|                                                                    |

+--------------------------------------------------------------------+

Root password [BLANK=auto generate it]: *
```

The first time the server is running, the root password must be inserted and confirmed.
The hash (+salt) of the inserted password will be stored in the file `config/security.json`. To know more about this topic, look at <<Security,Security>>.
Delete this file and restart the server to reinsert the password for server's root user.

The default rule of security are pretty basic.
The password length must be between 8 and 256 characters.
You can implement your own security policy.
Check <<Security-Policy,Security Policy>>.

You can skip the request for the password by passing it as a setting.
Example:

`-Darcadedb.server.rootPassword=this_is_a_password`

Once inserted the password for the root user, you should see this output.

```shell
Root password [BLANK=auto generate it]: ***********
*Please type the root password for confirmation (copy and paste will not work): ***********

INFO  [HttpServer] <ArcadeDB_0> - Starting HTTP Server (host=0.0.0.0 port=2480)...
INFO  [undertow] starting server: Undertow - 2.2.10.Final
INFO  [xnio] XNIO version 3.8.4.Final
INFO  [nio] XNIO NIO Implementation Version 3.8.4.Final
INFO  [threads] JBoss Threads version 3.1.0.Final
INFO  [HttpServer] <ArcadeDB_0> - HTTP Server started (host=0.0.0.0 port=2480)
INFO  [ArcadeDBServer] <ArcadeDB_0> ArcadeDB Server started (CPUs=16 MAXRAM=2.00GB)
```

By default, the following components start with the server:

- JMX Metrics, to monitor server performance and statistics
- HTTP Server, that listens on port 2480 by default. if 2480 is already occupied, then the next is taken up to 2489.

In the output above, the name `ArcadeDB_0` is the server name.
By default, `ArcadeDB_0` is used.
To specify a different name define it with the setting <<Settings,`server.name`>>, example:

```shell
~/arcadedb $ bin/server.sh -Darcadedb.server.name=ArcadeDB_Europe_0
```

In HA configuration, it's mandatory all the servers in cluster have different names.

==== Start server hint

To start the server from a location different than the ArcadeDB folder,
for example, if starting the server as a service,
set the environment variable `ARCADEDB_HOME` to the ArcadeDB folder:
```shell
export ARCADEDB_HOME=/path/to/arcadedb
```

==== Server modes

The server can be started in one of three modes, which affect the studio and logging:

[%header,cols=3]
|===
| Mode | Studio | Logging 
| `development` | Yes | Detailed
| `test` | Yes | Brief
| `production` | No | Brief
|===

The mode is controlled by the <<Setting-Table,`server.mode`>> setting with a default mode `development`. 

==== Create default database(s)

Instead of starting a server and then connect to it to create the default databases, ArcadeDB Server takes an initial default databases list by using the setting <<Settings,`server.defaultDatabases`>>.

```shell
~/arcadedb $ bin/server.sh -Darcadedb.server.defaultDatabases=Universe[elon:musk]
```

With the example above the database "Universe" will be created if doesn't exist, with user "elon", password "musk".

Once the server is started, multiple clients can be connected to the server by using one of the supported protocols:

- <<HTTP-API,HTTP/JSON>>
- <<Postgres-Driver,Postgres Driver>>
- <<MongoDB-API,MongoDB Driver>>
- <<Redis-API,Redis Driver>>

==== Logging

The log files are created in the folder `./log` with the filenames `arcadedb.log.X`,
where `X` is a number between 0 to 9, set up for log rotate.
The current log file has the number 0, and is rotated based on server starts or file size.

By default ArcadeDB does not log debug messages into the console and file. You can change this settings by editing the file `config/arcadedb-log.properties`. The file is a standard logging configuration file.

The default configuration is the following.

```
1  handlers = java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler, java.util.logging.FileHandler
2  .level = INFO
3  com.arcadedb.level = INFO
4  java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler.level = INFO
5  java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler.formatter = com.arcadedb.utility.AnsiLogFormatter
6  java.util.logging.FileHandler.level = INFO
7  java.util.logging.FileHandler.pattern=./log/arcadedb.log
8  java.util.logging.FileHandler.formatter = com.arcadedb.log.LogFormatter
9  java.util.logging.FileHandler.limit=100000000
10 java.util.logging.FileHandler.count=10
```

Where:

- Line 1 contains 2 loggers, the console and the file. This means logs will be written in both console (process output) and configured file (see (7))
- Line 2 sets INFO (information) as the default logging level for all the Java classes between FINER, FINE, INFO, WARNING, SEVERE
- Line 3 is as (2) but sets the level for ArcadeDB package only SEVERE
- Line 4 sets the minimum level the console logger filters the log file (below INFO level will be discarded)
- Line 5 sets the formatter used for the console. The AnsiLogFormatter supports ANSI color codes
- Line 6 sets the minimum level the file logger filters the log file (below INFO level will be discarded)
- Line 7 sets the path where to write the log file (the file will have a counter suffix, see (10))
- Line 8 sets the formatter used for the file
- Line 9 sets the maximum file size for the log, before creating a new file. By default is 100MB
- Line 10 sets the number of files to keep in the directory. By default is 10. This means that after the 10th file, the oldest file will be removed

If you're running ArcadeDB in embedded mode, make sure you're using the logging setting by specifying the `arcadedb-log.properties` file at JVM startup:

```
java ... -Djava.util.logging.config.file=$ARCADEDB_HOME/config/arcadedb-log.properties ...
```

You can also use your own configuration for logging. In this case replace the path above with your own file.
