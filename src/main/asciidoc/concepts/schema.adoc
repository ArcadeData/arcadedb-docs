=== Schema

ArcadeDB supports schema-less, schema-full and hybrid operation.
This means for all types that have a declared schema it is applied.
Minimally, a type (document, vertex or edge) needs to be declared in a database to be able to insert to,
i.e. <<#SQL-Create-Type,CREATE TYPE (SQL)>> and <<#SQL-Alter-Type,ALTER TYPE (SQL)>>.
Beyond the type, declaration properties with or without constraints, can be declared,
i.e. <<#SQL-Create-Property,CREATE PROPERTY (SQL)>> and <<#SQL-Alter-Property,ALTER PROPERTY (SQL)>>.
Inserting in to a declared type, all datasets are accepted (even with additional undeclared properties) as long as no property constraints are violated.
