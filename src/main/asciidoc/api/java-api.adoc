=== Java API (Embedded)

NOTE: ArcadeDB works in both synchronous and asynchronous modes. By using the asynchronous API you let to ArcadeDB to use all the resources of your hw/sw configuration without managing multiple threads.

==== Synchronous API

The Synchronous API execute the operation immediately and returns when it's finished. If you use a procedural approach, using the synchronous API is the easiest way to use ArcadeDB. In order to use all the resource of your machine, you need to work with multiple threads.

[discrete]
==== Asynchronous API

The Asynchronous API schedule the operation to be executed as soon as possible, but by a different thread. ArcadeDB optimizes the usage of asynchronous threads to be equals to the number of cores found in the machine (but it is still configurable). Use Asynchronous API if the response of the operation can be managed in asynchronous way.
