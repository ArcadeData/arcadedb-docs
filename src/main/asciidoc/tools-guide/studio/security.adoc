The Security Panel includes the following tabs:

* *Users* - Manage server users and their database access permissions
* *User Groups* - Define security groups with per-type CRUD permissions and database-level access
* *API Tokens* - Create and manage long-lived API tokens for programmatic access

===== Users

The Users tab displays all server users with their database access roles.
Each user shows the databases they can access and their role for each database (e.g., `admin`).

From this tab you can:

* Click *Create User* to add a new server user
* Click the edit icon to modify a user's database access and role assignments
* View which databases each user has access to

===== User Groups

image::studio-security-groups.png[User Groups]

User Groups define security groups that control per-type CRUD permissions and database-level access.
Groups are scoped to a specific database, selectable via the *Database* dropdown.

Each group displays:

* *Name* - The group identifier (e.g., `admin`, `*` for default)
* *Record Permissions* - Per-type CRUD access (e.g., `*: CRUD` means full access to all types)
* *Database Permissions* - Database-level permissions such as Schema, Settings, and Security management
* *Limits* - Resource limits including Result Set Limit (RSL) and Read Timeout (RT)
* *Actions* - Edit or delete the group

Click *Create Group* to define a new security group with custom permissions.

===== API Tokens

API Tokens provide long-lived authentication tokens for programmatic access to the ArcadeDB server.
Tokens are used for MCP integrations, REST API clients, and other automated workflows.

Each token displays:

* *Name* - A descriptive label for the token
* *Database* - The database the token grants access to
* *Created* - When the token was created
* *Expiration* - When the token expires
* *Token* - The token value (partially masked for security)
* *Actions* - Delete the token

Click *Create Token* to generate a new API token.
You will need to specify a name, target database, and expiration period.

NOTE: Copy the full token value immediately after creation, as it cannot be retrieved later.
