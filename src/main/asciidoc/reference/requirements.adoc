#### Memory

* `default` profile: 800MB
* `low-ram` profile: 16MB

see also <<ram-config,RAM Configuration>>.

#### Java

ArcadeDB runs on the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_version_history[version] *21* (LTS);
tested JREs are:

* https://openjdk.org/[OpenJDK] 17 is **NOT** compatible,
* https://openjdk.org/[OpenJDK] 21 is compatible and the suggested version to use.
* https://corretto.aws/[Corretto] 21 is also compatible.

NOTE: The **headless** variants of JRE packages are compatible to ArcadeDB.

NOTE: For now, a separate Java 17 branch and packages are maintained, see the https://github.com/ArcadeData/arcadedb?tab=readme-ov-file#java-versions[README].

##### Java 17

Java 17 is supported through a special `java17` branch.
