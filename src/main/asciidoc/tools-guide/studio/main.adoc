To use the ArcadeDB Studio, point your web browser to the server and port that hosts the ArcadeDB server (in "development" or "test" <<server-modes,mode>>).
For instance, when running ArcadeDB locally with the default port this means: http://localhost:2480 .

When first accessing Studio, a login dialog is displayed where you enter your username and password.

The Query tab has three main areas: the sidebar, the query editor, and the result panel.

===== Sidebar Panels

The icon sidebar on the left of the Query tab provides five panels:

* *Overview* - Displays the database schema with all vertex, edge, and document types shown as colored badges.
Click on any type to quickly query its records.

===== Execute a command/query

In order to execute a command (or query), select the language first. By default is SQL, but you can choose between:

* *SQL* (for any models, including graphs and documents)
* *SQL Script* (multiple commands/queries)
* *Open Cypher (New Native Engine)* (only for graphs)
* *Gremlin* (only for graphs)
* *Cypher (Old Engine)* (only for graphs)
* *GraphQL*
* *MongoDB* (only for documents)
* *Redis*

Based on the selected language, the command text area will adjust the syntax highlighting to simplify the writing of the command.

The *Auto Limit* dropdown sets a default limit for queries that do not specify one, preventing accidentally large result sets.

Click the play button (or press `Ctrl+Enter`) to execute the command.
Use the bookmark button to save the current query for later use.

The result of the command will appear in the result area as a <<studio-table,Table>>, <<studio-graph,Graph>>, <<studio-json,JSON>>, or Explain view.
