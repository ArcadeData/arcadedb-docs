=== Users

Users are stored in the file `config/server-users.jsonl` file.
The JSONL format means one json per line.
When the server starts always checks if there are any users configured.
If the user file is empty, the `root` user is created with a password the user must enter in the console where the server is starting.
Example:

```shell
+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                WARNING: FIRST RUN CONFIGURATION                    |
+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
| This is the first time the server is running. Please type a        |
| password of your choice for the 'root' user or leave it blank      |
| to auto-generate it.                                               |
|                                                                    |
| To avoid this message set the environment variable or JVM          |
| setting `arcadedb.server.rootPassword` to the root password to use.|
+--------------------------------------------------------------------+

Root password [BLANK=auto generate it]: ***********
Please type the root password for confirmation (copy and paste will not work): ***********
```

Example of `config/server-users.jsonl` file:

```json
{"name":"root","password":"PBKDF2WithHmacSHA256$65536$hcv0joKV/o/q+KOVmcwNUqhEq1w2/j8OVnEkkVjzkeg=$2q2u4rjUlJjgoKBX9sG0rV0bOh6aHo+RhHsOkXneGkM=","databases":{"*":["admin"]}}
```

In the users file the following information are stored per user:

- Name, mandatory
- Password.
It is always saved hashed by using the algorithm `PBKDF2` with a configurable salt (default = 32).
The password is mandatory for all the users, but root.
In the case root has no password, then ArcadeDB server asks to insert a password at startup (see above).
- Databases, as the map database name and set of groups for that database. "\*" is a special wildcard and means any.
The configuration `"databases":{"*":["admin"]}` means use the "admin" group for any database.

[d2,admin-user]
....
vars: {
  d2-config: {
    sketch: true
  }
}
direction: right

root: {
  shape: rectangle
  label: "root\n(User)"
}

admin: {
  shape: rectangle
  label: "admin\n(Group)"
}

database: {
  shape: rectangle
  label: "Any Database"
  style.stroke-dash: 5
}

admin -> database: {label: "in"}
root -> admin: {label: "belongsTo"}
....

ArcadeDB allows each user to belong to zero or multiple groups.
If no groups are defined, the default setting for the group `*` are used.

The following configuration defines "Jay" user to belong to "BlogWriters" in "Blog" database and "Editors" in the "Library" database:

```json
{
  "databases": {
    "Blog": ["BlogWriters"],
    "Library": ["Editors"]
  }
}
```

[d2,jay-user]
....
vars: {
  d2-config: {
    sketch: true
  }
}
direction: right

Jay: {
  shape: rectangle
  label: "Jay\n(User)"
}

BlogWriters: {
  shape: rectangle
  label: "BlogWriters\n(Group)"
}

Editors: {
  shape: rectangle
  label: "Editors\n(Group)"
}

BlogDatabase: {
  shape: rectangle
  label: "Blog Database"
  style.stroke-dash: 5
}

LibraryDatabase: {
  shape: rectangle
  label: "Library Database"
  style.stroke-dash: 5
}

BlogWriters -> BlogDatabase: {label: "in"}
Editors -> LibraryDatabase: {label: "in"}
Jay -> BlogWriters: {label: "belongsTo"}
Jay -> Editors: {label: "belongsTo"}
....

The declaration above implicitly assigns Jay to the default group for any other database configured.
The default configuration for the default group is no access, where the user cannot read or write in the database.
