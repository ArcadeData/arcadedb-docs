Run the console by executing `console.sh` under `bin` directory from the `arcadedb` directory:

[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ bin/console.sh

ArcadeDB Console v.{revnumber} - Copyrights (c) 2021 Arcade Data Ltd (https://arcadedb.com)

>
----

The following command-line arguments are supported by the console:

* `-D` allows to pass <<#Settings,settings>>,
* `-b` enables batch mode which exits after executing all commands passed via the command-lines.
* `-fae` fail-at-end if error occurs during batch (normally batch mode breaks execution at an error).

The console supports these direct commands (not evaluated by the query engine):

----

NOTE: The `close` command can be used without path or url, then it closes the currently connected database.

NOTE: It can be useful to wrap longer scripts called via `LOAD myscript.sql` in a transaction via `BEGIN; LOAD myscript.sql; COMMIT;` to ensure completion of write operations.

NOTE: The comment command `-- ` is useful for scripts.

IMPORTANT: The multi-line comment syntax `/* ... */` is not supported in the console, since the console reads from the terminal and script files line by line. It is required and recommended to use the single-line comment syntax `-- ` for inline code docu or headers.

[[Console-Tutorial]]
==== Tutorial

Let's create our first database, located in our local filesystem.
To identify the database you specify in a connection string.
It could be either absolute, or relative to the database directory.
The database directory can be explicitely set, when you start the console, like 

[source,shell]
----
$ ./bin/console.sh -Darcadedb.server.databaseDirectory=/databases
----

If no database directory is given at startup, it is the `databases` directory under the root path of the arcadedb server by default.
To create a new database under the database directory, you would run the following command in the console

[source,sql]
----
> CREATE DATABASE mydb
----

If you want to create your database somewhere else in the local filesystem, you can specify a different path to the database:

[source,sql]
----
> CREATE DATABASE data/mydb
----

Once the database has been created, you can simply connect to it:

[source,sql]
----
> CONNECT mydb
----

Or if on a different path, specify the path where the database is located:

[source,sql]
----
> CONNECT data/mydb
----


If you're using the ArcadeDB Server, you can create the database through the server:

[source,sql]
----
> CREATE DATABASE remote:localhost/mydb root arcadedb-password
----

Once created, you can always connect to the server with the following command:

[source,sql]
----
> CONNECT remote:localhost/mydb root arcadedb-password
----

Let's also create a user with access to "mydb":

[source,sql]
----
> CREATE USER elon IDENTIFIED BY muskmusk GRANT CONNECT TO mydb
----

Now let's create a "Profile" type:

[source,sql]
----
{mydb}> CREATE DOCUMENT TYPE Profile
----

[source]
----
+---------+--------------------+
|NAME     |VALUE               |
+---------+--------------------+
|operation|create document type|
|typeName |Profile             |
+---------+--------------------+
Command executed in 99ms
----

Check your new type is there:

[source,sql]
----
{mydb}> INFO TYPES
----

[source]
----
AVAILABLE TYPES
+-------+--------+-----------+-------------------------------------+-----------+-------------+
|NAME   |TYPE    |SUPER TYPES|BUCKETS                              |PROPERTIES |SYNC STRATEGY|
+-------+--------+-----------+-------------------------------------+-----------+-------------+
|Profile|Document|0[]        |8[Profile_0,...,Profile_7]|0[]       |round-robin|             |
+-------+--------+-----------+-------------------------------------+-----------+-------------+
----

You can also query the defined types by executing the following SQL query: `select from schema:types`.

Finally, let's create a document of type "Profile":

[source,sql]
----
{mydb}> INSERT INTO Profile SET name = 'Jay', lastName = 'Miner'
----

[source]
----
DOCUMENT @type:Profile @rid:#1:0
+--------+-----+
|NAME    |VALUE|
+--------+-----+
|name    |Jay  |
|lastName|Miner|
+--------+-----+
Command executed in 17ms
----

You can see your brand new record with RID `#1:0`.
Now let's query the database to see if our new document can be found:

[source,sql]
----
{mydb}> SELECT FROM Profile
----

[source]
----
DOCUMENT @type:Profile @rid:#1:0
+--------+-----+
|NAME    |VALUE|
+--------+-----+
|name    |Jay  |
|lastName|Miner|
+--------+-----+
Command executed in 37ms
----

Here we go: our document is there.

Remember that a transaction is automatically started. In order to make changes persistent, execute a `COMMIT` command.
When the console exists (`exit` or `quit` command), the pending transaction is committed automatically.

[[Console-Scripting]]
==== Scripting

The console can also run local SQL scripts using the `LOAD` command:

[source,shell]
----
$ bin/console.sh -b "LOAD myscript.sql"
----

or passing the commands as string argument:

[source,shell]
----
$ bin/console.sh "CREATE DATABASE test; CREATE DOCUMENT TYPE doc; BACKUP DATABASE; exit;"
----

NOTE: Make sure to `create database` or `connect` to a database first in the script before using <<SQL,SQL commands>>.

NOTE: All commands (of a script) are executed, disregarding if a previous command failed.

[[Server-Interaction]]
==== Console-Server Interaction

NOTE: The console cannot access a database via local connection when a server is running.

When the server is running it locks all (opened) databases,
hence the console cannot access these databases via local connection which utilizes the file system.
Nonetheless, the console can still connect to these databases via a remote connection,
particularly, using `localhost` if the console is running on the same machine as the server:

[source,sql]
----
> CONNECT remote:localhost/mydb root arcadedb-password
----
