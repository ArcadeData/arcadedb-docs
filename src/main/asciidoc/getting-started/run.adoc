=== Run ArcadeDB

image:../images/edit.png[link="https://github.com/ArcadeData/arcadedb-docs/blob/main/src/main/asciidoc/getting-started/run.adoc" float="right"]

You can run ArcadeDB in the following ways:

- In the cloud (coming soon), by running an ArcadeDB instance on Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Engine.
- On-premise, on your servers, any OS is good.
You can run with Docker, Podman, Kubernetes or bare metal.
- On x86(-64), arm(64), or any other hardware supporting a JRE (Java* Runtime Environment)
- <<embedded-server,Embedded>>, if you develop with a language that runs on the JVM (Java* Virtual Machine)*

To reach the best performance, use ArcadeDB in <<embedded-server,embedded>> mode to reach two million insertions per second on common hardware.
If you need to scale up with the queries, run a HA (high availability) configuration with at least three servers, and a load balancer in front.
Run ArcadeDB with Kubernetes to have an automatic setup of servers in HA with a load balancer upfront.

==== Embedded

This mode is possible only if your application is running in a JVM* (Java* Virtual Machine).
In this configuration ArcadeDB runs in the same JVM as your application.
In this way you completely avoid the client/server communication cost (TCP/IP, marshalling/unmarshalling, etc.) If the JVM that hosts your application crashes, then also ArcadeDB would crash, but don't worry, ArcadeDB uses a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write-ahead_logging[WAL] to recover partially committed transactions.
Your data is safe!
Check the <<embedded-server,Embedded Server>> section.

==== Client-Server

This is the classic way people use a DBMS, like with relational databases.
The ArcadeDB server exposes <<http-json-api,HTTP/JSON API>>, so you can connect to ArcadeDB from any language without even using drivers.
Take a look at the <<api-reference,API and Driver Reference>> chapter for more information.

==== High Availability (HA)

You can spin up as many ArcadeDB servers as you want to have a HA setup and scale up with queries that can be executed on any servers.
ArcadeDB uses a Raft based election system to guarantee the consistency of the database.
For more information look at <<high-availability,High Availability>>.

==== Getting Started

===== All Platforms

1. Download latest release from https://github.com/ArcadeData/arcadedb/releases[Github]

2. Unpack `tar -xzf arcadedb-{revnumber}`
** Change into directory: `cd arcadedb-{revnumber}`

3. Launch server
** Linux / MacOS: `bin/server.sh`
** Windows: `bin\server.bat`

4. Exit server via **CTRL+C**

5. Interact with server
** Studio: http://localhost:2480[`http://localhost:2480`]
** Console:
*** Linux / MacOS: `bin/console.sh`
*** Windows: `bin\console.bat`

===== Windows via Scoop

Instead of using manual install you can use Scoop installer, instructions are available on their https://scoop.sh[project website].

[#scoop-installer,powershell]
----
scoop bucket add extras
scoop install arcadedb
----

This downloads and installs ArcadeDB on your box and makes following two commands available:

[#scoop-shims,powershell]
----
arcadedb-console
arcadedb-server
----

You should use these instead of `bin\console.bat` and `bin\server.bat` mentioned above.

===== Mac OS X

Popular way to get opensource software is to use https://brew.sh[homebrew project].

Currently, ArcadeDB is not available through an official Homebrew formula.
To install ArcadeDB on Mac OS X:

1. Download the latest release from https://github.com/ArcadeData/arcadedb/releases
2. Extract the archive to your preferred location (e.g., `/usr/local/arcadedb`)
3. Add the `bin` directory to your PATH:

[source,bash]
----
echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/arcadedb/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
----

Alternatively, you can run ArcadeDB using Docker:

[source,bash,subs="+attributes"]
----
docker run --rm -p 2424:2424 -p 2480:2480 -p 5432:5432 \
    --name arcadedb arcadedata/arcadedb:{revnumber}
----
