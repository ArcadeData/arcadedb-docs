Studio is the web tool that comes bundled with ArcadeDB Server. It starts automatically on port 2480. If you have installed ArcadeDB, and it's running on your local computer, then you can access Studio at http://localhost:2480. Replace "localhost" with the host name or IP address of the server where ArcadeDB server is running.

If you're running ArcadeDB server as <<Embedded-Server,Embedded>>, please make sure the jar `arcadedb-studio-<version>.jar` is included in your classpath.
