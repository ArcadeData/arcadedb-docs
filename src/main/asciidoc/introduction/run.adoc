=== Run ArcadeDB
image:../images/edit.png[link="https://github.com/ArcadeData/arcadedb-docs/blob/main/src/main/asciidoc/introduction/run.adoc" float="right"]

You can run ArcadeDB in the following ways:

- On the cloud (coming soon), by using ArcadeDB instance on Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Engine marketplaces
- On-premise, on your servers, any OS is good. You can run with Docker, Podman, Kubernetes or bare metal.
- Embedded, if you develop with a language that runs on the JVM (Java* Virtual Machine)*

To reach the best performance, use ArcadeDB in embedded mode to reach 2 million insertions per second on common hardware.
If you need to scale up with the queries, run a HA (high availability) configuration with at least 3 servers, and a load balancer in front.
Run ArcadeDB with Kubernetes to have an automatic setup of servers in HA with a load balancer upfront.

==== Embedded

This mode is possible only if your application is running in a JVM* (Java* Virtual Machine).
In this configuration ArcadeDB runs in the same JVM as your application.
In this way you completely avoid the client/server communication cost (TCP/IP, marshalling/unmarshalling, etc.)
If the JVM that hosts your application crashes, then also ArcadeDB would crash, but don't worry, ArcadeDB uses a WAL to recover partially committed transactions.
Your data is safe!

==== Client-Server

This is the classic way people use a DBMS, like with relational databases.
The ArcadeDB server exposes <<HTTP/JSON Protocol,HTTP/JSON API>>, so you can connect to ArcadeDB from any language without even using drivers.
Take a look at the <<Drivers,driver>> chapter for more information.

==== High Availability (HA)

You can spin up as many ArcadeDB servers as you want to have a HA setup and scale up with queries that can be executed on any servers.
ArcadeDB uses a Raft based election system to guarantee the consistency of the database.
For more information look at <<#High-Availability,High Availability>>.

==== Binaries

|===
|                     | **Linux** / **Mac** | **Windows**
| <<_server,Server>>  | `bin/server.sh`     | `bin\server.bat`
| <<Console,Console>> | `bin/console.sh`    | `bin\console.bat`
|===

==== Getting Started

===== All Platforms

1. Download latest release from https://github.com/ArcadeData/arcadedb/releases[Github]

2. Unpack `tar -xzf arcadedb-{revnumber}`
    * Change into directory: `cd arcadedb-{revnumber}`

3. Launch server
    * Linux / MacOS: `bin/server.sh`
    * Windows: `bin\server.bat`

4. Exit server via **CTRL+C**

5. Interact with server
    * Studio: http://localhost:2480[`http://localhost:2480`]
    * Console:
        ** Linux / MacOS: `bin/console.sh`
        ** Windows: `bin\console.bat`

===== Windows via Scoop

Instead of using manual install you can use Scoop installer, instructions are available on the https://scoop.sh[project website].

[#scoop-installer,powershell]
----
scoop bucket add extras
scoop install arcadedb
----

This downloads and installs ArcadeDB on your box and makes following two commands available:

[#scoop-shims,powershell]
----
arcadedb-console
arcadedb-server
----

You should use these instead of `bin\console.bat` and `bin\server.bat` mentioned above.

===== Mac OS X

Popular way to get opensource software is to use https://brew.sh[homebrew project].
