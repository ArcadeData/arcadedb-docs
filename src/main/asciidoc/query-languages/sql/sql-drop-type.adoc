Removes a type from the schema.
To drop a type (safely), first, all its instances need to be removed.

*Syntax*

[source,sql]
----
DROP TYPE <type> [UNSAFE] [IF EXISTS]

----

* *`&lt;type&gt;`* Defines the type you want to remove.
* *`UNSAFE`* Defines whether the command drops non-empty edge and vertex types.
Note, this can disrupt data consistency.
Be sure to create a backup before running it.
* *`IF EXISTS`* Prevent errors if the type does not exits when attempting to drop it.

NOTE: Bear in mind, that the schema must remain coherent.
For instance, avoid removing types that are super-types to others.
This operation won't delete the associated bucket.

*Examples*

* Remove the type `Account`:

----
ArcadeDB> DROP TYPE Account
----
