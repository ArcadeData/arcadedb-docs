image:../images/edit.png[link="https://github.com/ArcadeData/arcadedb-docs/blob/main/src/main/asciidoc/sql/SQL-Import-Database.md" float=right]

Executes an import of the database into the current one. Usually an import database is executed on an empty database, but it is
possible to execute on any database. In case of conflict (unique index key already existent, etc.), the conflicting records will not
be imported. The importer automatically recognize the file between the following formats:

* *OrientDB* database export
* *Neo4J* database export
* *GraphML* database export. This format does not support complex types, like collection of elements. Using GraphSON instead of
 GraphML is recommended
* *GraphSON* database export

*Syntax*

[source,sql]

IMPORT DATABASE [ <url> ]

 ** `file://` as prefix for files located on the same file system where ArcadeDB is running.
