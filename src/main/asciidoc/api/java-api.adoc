NOTE: ArcadeDB works in both synchronous and asynchronous modes.
By using the asynchronous API you let to ArcadeDB to use all the resources of your hw/sw configuration without managing multiple threads.

|The Synchronous API executes the operation immediately, by the current thread, and returns when it's finished. If you use a procedural approach, using the synchronous API is the easiest way to use ArcadeDB. In order to use all the resource of your machine, you might use multi-threading in your application.
|The Asynchronous API schedules jobs to be executed as soon as possible by a pool of threads. ArcadeDB optimizes the usage of asynchronous threads pool to be equals to the number of cores found in the machine (you can modify it via API). Use Asynchronous API if the response of the operation can be managed in asynchronous way. Thanks to the asynchronous API, your application doesn't need to be multi-threads to use all the available cores.
