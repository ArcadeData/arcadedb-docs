== Security

ArcadeDB manages the security at server level only.
This means if you work in embedded mode, there is no security available by default unless you install the server security or your own implementation.
Without any kind of security active, any user can read and write in the database.
For this reason it's important your application is managing security and profiling.
You can work in embedded mode and still run a `ArcadeDBServer` instance to use the security for the incoming connections.
