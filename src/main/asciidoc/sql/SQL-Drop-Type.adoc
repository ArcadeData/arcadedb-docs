=== SQL - `DROP TYPE`

image:../images/edit.png[link="https://github.com/ArcadeData/arcadedb-docs/blob/main/src/main/asciidoc/sql/SQL-Drop-Type.md" float=right]

Removes a type from the schema.

*Syntax*

[source,sql]
----
DROP TYPE <type> [ UNSAFE ][IF EXISTS]

----

* *`&lt;type&gt;`* Defines the type you want to remove.
* *`UNSAFE`* Defines whether the command drops non-empty edge and vertex typees. Note, this can disrupt data consistency. Be sure to create a backup before running it.
* *`IF EXISTS`* Prevent errors if the type does not exits when attempting to drop it.

NOTE: Bear in mind, that the schema must remain coherent. For instance, avoid removing calsses that are super-typees to others. This operation won't delete the associated bucket.

*Examples*

* Remove the type `Account`:

----
ArcadeDB> DROP TYPE Account
----
