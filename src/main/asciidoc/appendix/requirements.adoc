#### Java

ArcadeDB runs on the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_version_history[versions] *11* to *15*;
tested JREs are:

* https://openjdk.org/[OpenJDK] 11
* ...

Newer JRE versions (**16** and onwards) are currently incompatible due to a bug in Gremlin,
see https://github.com/ArcadeData/arcadedb/issues/17[ArcadeDB: Gremlin doesn't work with Java 16+] and https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TINKERPOP-2703[Tinkerpop: Build on JDK17].
