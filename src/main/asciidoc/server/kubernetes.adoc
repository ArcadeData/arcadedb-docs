Before starting the cluster, set ArcadeDB Server root password as a secret (replace <password> with the root password you want to use):

```shell
~/arcadedb $ kubectl create secret generic arcadedb-credentials --from-literal=rootPassword='<password>'
```

This will set the password in the `rootPassword` environment variable. The ArcadeDB server will use this password for the `root` user.

Now you can start a Kubernetes cluster with 3 servers by using the default configuration:

```shell
~/arcadedb $ kubectl apply -f config/arcadedb-statefulset.yaml
```

For more information on ArcadeDB Kubernetes config https://github.com/ArcadeData/arcadedb/blob/main/package/src/main/config/arcadedb-statefulset.yaml[please check].

In order to scale up or down with the number of replicas, use this:

```shell
~/arcadedb $ kubectl scale statefulsets arcadedb-server --replicas=<new-number-of-replicas>
```

Where the value of `<new-number-of-replicas>` is the new number of replicas. Example:

```shell
~/arcadedb $ kubectl scale statefulsets arcadedb-server --replicas=3
```

Scaling up and down doesn't affect current workload. There are no pauses when a server enters/exits from the cluster.

==== Troubleshooting

The most common issue with using K8S is with the setting of the root password for the server (see at the beginning of this section).

Follows some useful commands for troubleshooting issues with ArcadeDB and Kubernetes.

Display the status of a pod:

```shell
~/arcadedb $ kubectl describe pod arcadedb-0
```

Replace "arcadedb-0" with the server container you want to use.

To display the logs of the first server:

```shell
~/arcadedb $ kubectl logs arcadedb-0
```

Replace "arcadedb-0" with the server container you want to use.

To remove all the containers and restart the cluster again, execute these 2 commands:

```shell
~/arcadedb $ kubectl delete all --all --namespace default
~/arcadedb $ kubectl apply -f config/arcadedb-statefulset.yaml
```
