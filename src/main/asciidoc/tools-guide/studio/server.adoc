* *Run On Server* - In HA clusters, which server runs backups (`$leader` or `*`)

*Schedule*

* *Schedule Type* - Choose between frequency-based or CRON-based scheduling
* *Frequency* - Minutes between backups (when using frequency-based scheduling)
* *CRON Expression* - Cron expression for precise scheduling (when using CRON-based scheduling)
* *Time Window* - Optional time window to restrict when backups can run

*Retention Policy*

* *Max Backup Files* - Maximum number of backup files to keep per database
* *Use Tiered Retention* - Enable grandfathering backup rotation
* *Tiered Settings* - Number of hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly backups to retain

Click *Save Configuration* to save changes.
The configuration is stored in `config/backup.json`.

NOTE: After saving a new configuration for the first time, a server restart is required to activate the auto-backup scheduler plugin.

* *Permissions* - Control which operations MCP clients can perform: Reads, Insert, Update, Delete, Schema

*Allowed Users*

Configure which server users are authorized to access the MCP endpoint.

*Connection Info*

The right panel provides ready-to-use configuration snippets for popular LLM clients:

* *Claude Desktop* - JSON configuration for `claude_desktop_config.json`
* *Claude Code / Cursor* - Configuration for MCP-compatible code editors

Select the *Auth Method* (Basic Auth or API Token) and copy the generated configuration snippet directly into your client's configuration file.
