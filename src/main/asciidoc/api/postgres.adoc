ArcadeDB Server supports a subset of the https://postgres.com[Postgres] wire protocol, such as connection and queries.

To start the Postgres plugin, enlist it in the <<#_settings,`server.plugins`>> settings.
To specify multiple plugins, use the comma `,` as separator.
Example:

```shell
~/arcadedb $ bin/server.sh -Darcadedb.server.plugins=Postgres Protocol:com.arcadedb.postgres.PostgresProtocolPlugin
```

In case you're running ArcadeDB with Docker, use `--env` to pass settings:

```shell
docker run --rm -p 2480:2480 -p 2424:2424 --env arcadedb.server.rootPassword=playwithdata --env arcadedb.server.plugins=Postgres:com.arcadedb.postgres.PostgresProtocolPlugin arcadedata/arcadedb:latest
```


The Server output will contain this line:

```
2021-07-08 19:05:06.081 INFO  [ArcadeDBServer] <ArcadeDB_0> - Postgres Protocol plugin started
```

Once you have enabled the Postgres Protocol, you can interact with ArcadeDB server by using any Postgres drivers.
The driver sends the queries to the ArcadeDB server without parsing or checking the syntax.
For this reason, even if ArcadeDB SQL is different from Postgres SQL, you're still able to execute any ArcadeDB SQL command through the Postgres driver.
Check out the following list with the official drivers for the most popular programming languages:

NOTE: Some tools compatible with Postgres may execute queries on internal Postgres tables to retrieve the schema. Those tables are not present in ArcadeDB, so it may return errors at startup. If the tool that you use to work with Postgres is not compatible with ArcadeDB, please https://github.com/ArcadeData/arcadedb/issues[open an issue].
