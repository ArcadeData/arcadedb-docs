=== C#/.NET (HTTP/JSON)

[discrete]
==== Sample Code

In C#/.NET 7.0/8.0, HTTP/JSON requests can be made using the `HTTPClient` class inside an async function. 
  
In real situations, the `HTTPClient` object should not be created or discarded on each request. `HTTPClient` should be typically created once in the lifespan of an application, stored in a Singleton Instance or static reference/class, and reused for each request. Here it is created in the function just for simplicity.

The following example demonstrates a simple function which will add a record of the type `Profile` to a database named `mydb` with the name `Alexander`.

public async void addProfileName(){
    HttpClient httpClient = new(); //typically instantiate this only once over course of application, then reuse
    HttpRequestMessage msg = new();
    msg.Method = HttpMethod.Post;
    string authString = "root:arcadedb-password"; //add your password here
    string base64AuthString = Convert.ToBase64String(System.Text.ASCIIEncoding.ASCII.GetBytes(authString));
    msg.Headers.Authorization = new("Basic", base64AuthString);
    msg.RequestUri = new Uri("http://serveraddress:2480/api/v1/command/mydb"); //add your server address (or localhost) and db name
    HttpContent httpContent = new StringContent("{ \"language\": \"sql\", \"command\": \"INSERT into Profile set name = \'Alexander\'\" }", Encoding.UTF8, "application/json"); //customize command here
    msg.Content = httpContent;
    HttpResponseMessage response = await httpClient.SendAsync(msg);
    string responseString = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
    Debug.WriteLine("SENT REQUEST, RESPONSE: " + responseString);
}
