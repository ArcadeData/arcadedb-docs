[[api]]
== API

The power of a Multi-Model database is also in the way you can interact with it.
ArcadeDB supports multiple languages, so it's easier to use it coming from other DBMS.

[[drivers]]
=== Drivers

ArcadeDB provides <<http-api,HTTP API>> to interface to the server from a remote application. You can use any programming language that supports HTTP calls (pretty much any language) or use a driver to have a little abstraction over <<http-api,HTTP API>>.
