=== SQL - `REBUILD INDEX`

image:../images/edit.png[link="https://github.com/ArcadeData/arcadedb-docs/blob/main/src/main/asciidoc/sql/sql-Rebuild-Index.adoc" float=right]

Rebuilds automatic indexes.

*Syntax*

[source,sql]
----
REBUILD INDEX <index-name>

----

* *`&lt;index-name&gt;`* It is the index name that you want to rebuild.
Use `*` to rebuild all automatic indexes.
Quote the index name if it contains special characters like square brackets.

NOTE: During the rebuild, any idempotent queries made against the index, skip the index and perform sequential scans. This means
that queries run slower during this operation. Non-idempotent commands, such as <<sql-Insert,`INSERT`>>, <<sql-Update,`UPDATE`>>,
and <<sql-Delete,`DELETE`>> are blocked waiting until the indexes are rebuilt.

NOTE: During normal operations an index rebuild is not necessary. Rebuild an index only if it breaks.

*Examples*

* Rebuild an index on the `email` property on the type `Profile`:

----
ArcadeDB> REBUILD INDEX `Profile[email]`
----

* Rebuild all indexes:

----
ArcadeDB> REBUILD INDEX *
----
