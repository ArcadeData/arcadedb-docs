== API and Driver Reference

ArcadeDB provides <<http-json-api,HTTP/JSON API>> to interface to the server from a remote application.
You can use any programming language that supports HTTP calls (pretty much any language) or use a driver to have a little abstraction over <<http-json-api,HTTP/JSON API>>.
