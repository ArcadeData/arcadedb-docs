ArcadeDB is able to import a database exported from OrientDB in JSON format.

For more information about how to export a database from OrientDB, look at http://orientdb.com/docs/3.1.x/console/Console-Command-Export.html[Export Database].

ArcadeDB does not support users at database level as with OrientDB, but only at server level.
For ths reason, if you specify the option `-s`, a security.json file will be created containing the users found in OUser.
If the security.json file is located under the directory `config`, the server will use the exported users.

Example of importing with the generation of security.json file:

```shell
~/arcadedb $ bin/orientdb-importer.sh -i orientdb-export.tgz -d mydb -s config/security.json
```

==== Configuration

- `-i <input-file>`    (string) OrientDB export file path
- `-d <database-path>` (string) path on local filesystem where to create the ArcadeDB database.
To just check the OrientDB import file, don't specify any database path
- `-s <security-file>` (string) path to the security file to generate by reading the OUser class in OrientDB.
Default is null.
- `-o` (boolean) true to overwrite an existent database.
If false and the `database-path` already exists, an error is thrown.
Default is false.
- `-b <batch-size>` (integer) Number of records to store per transaction.
Default is 10,000 records
