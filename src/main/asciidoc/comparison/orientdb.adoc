ArcadeDB was born initially as a fork of OrientDB.
Today more than 80% of ArcadeDB code has been rewritten from scratch from the same original authors of the OrientDB project.
This allowed to get rid of many legacy parts that makes OrientDB slow, heavy and hard to maintain.
Also, since OrientDB was the first Multi-Model project out there, a lot of work of the initial R&D and experiments are still in the OrientDB code base.
You can consider ArcadeDB as the natural evolution of the legacy OrientDB project.

If you're coming from OrientDB, please use the <<OrientDB-Importer,OrientDB Importer>> tool to import an OrientDB export into an ArcadeDB database.

**Main similarities and differences**

- Both can run on any platform
- Both can run SQL; ArcadeDB and OrientDB both share the same SQL Engine.
- ArcadeDB's SQL dialect is closely related to OrientDB's OSQL, but more streamlined. 
- ArcadeDB "types" are the "classes" in OrientDB
- ArcadeDB "buckets" are similar to the "clusters" in OrientDB, but without the limitation of having only 32,768 clusters. The maximum number of buckets in ArcadeDB are 2,147,483,648
- Both ArcadeDB and OrientDB support multiple inheritance
- ArcadeDB shares the same database instance across threads,
this makes it much easier developing with ArcadeDB than with OrientDB with multi-threads applications.
With OrientDB you have to use a pool of databases and be careful on acquiring and releasing instanced.
With ArcadeDB create a Database instance at the beginning, share it with all your threads and close when your application shuts down.
- ArcadeDB uses thread locals only to manage transactions, while OrientDB makes a strong usage of thread local structures internally, making hard to pass the database instance across threads and a pool if needed
- There is no base `V` and `E` classes in ArcadeDB, but rather vertex and edge are first type citizens types of records.
Use `CREATE VERTEX TYPE Product` vs OrientDB `CREATE CLASS Product EXTENDS V`. Same for edges, use `CREATE EDGE TYPE Sold` vs OrientDB `CREATE CLASS Sold EXTENDS E`.
- ArcadeDB saves every type and property name in the dictionary to compress record size by storing only the names ids (as varint)
- ArcadeDB keeps the MVCC counter on the page rather than on the record. This means the transaction must be repeated if there are consurrent modification on the same page, not only on the same record (like with OrientDB)
- ArcadeDB manages everything as files and pages, for transactions and replication.
OrientDB has a mixed pages/record approach. Using the page-only approach keeps everything much faster and easier to maintain
- ArcadeDB allows custom page size per bucket/index
- ArcadeDB supports light-weight edges (edges without properties), but they must be used with a different syntax.
This avoids automatic upgrade of edges and unexpected behavior experienced in OrientDB
- ArcadeDB supports replication by using a Leader/Replica model with Raft election without sharding for now.
Instead, OrientDB is based on a Multi-Master model (the sharding was experimental, never production ready) with a multi-paxos style protocol not efficient on large volume of transactions and still not rock-solid after years because of its complexity
- ArcadeDB replicates the pages across servers, so all the databases are identical at binary level, while with OrientDB there is a mix of logical and physical replication leaving room for not managed edge cases
- ArcadeDB Server supports HTTP/JSON, Postgres, MongoDB and Redis protocols, while OrientDB supports only HTTP/JSON and a proprietary binary protocol
- ArcadeDB supports OrientDB SQL, the latest Gremlin version, Open Cypher and MongoDB query language, while OrientDB supports only its SQL and an old version of Gremlin

**What ArcadeDB does not support**

- ArcadeDB supports only UNIQUE constraints on data (by creating an index), while OrientDB supports multiple constraints and validation at class level
- ArcadeDB does not provide a dirty manager, so it's up to the developer to mark the object to save by calling `.save()` method on it.
This makes the code of ArcadeDB smaller without handling edge cases, but if you have a tree of objects it is the developer responsibility to mark the modified objects without auto-tracking
- ArcadeDB does not allow a document to have no class. If you want to store an embedded document without a class, use a `Map<String,Object>` instead

**What ArcadeDB has more than OrientDB**

- ArcadeDB is much Faster than OrientDB.
On a single server it is common to see 10X-20X improvement in performance, with 3 nodes the gap in performance with OrientDB can reach 50X-200X faster.
With 10 servers it is over 500X faster than OrientDB!
- The maximum number of buckets are `2,147,483,648`, while with OrientDB the maximum number of clusters is `32,768`
- ArcadeDB uses much less RAM.
With the right tuning over the settings, it's able to work with only 4MB of JVM heap, while OrientDB requires at least 8GB to run
- ArcadeDB codebase is much smaller and easier to maintain and improve
- ArcadeDB is lightweight, the engine is about 1MB
- ArcadeDB mandate all the operations to be inside a transaction, even operations against the schema. With OrientDB, they are no transactional and in case of error they can break the database
- ArcadeDB saves every type and property names in the dictionary to compress the record by storing only the names ids
- ArcadeDB is much more efficient on data structure.
That means ArcadeDB takes less space on disk than OrientDB and uses less RAM for caching
- ArcadeDB natively supports asynchronous operations (by using `.async()`).
Asynchronous calls are automatically balanced on the available cores with a nice API
