You can create a new database from scratch or open an existent one.
Most of the API works in both synchronous and asynchronous modes.
The asynchronous API are available from the `<db>.async()` object.

To start from scratch, let's create a new database.
The entry point it's the `<<databasefactory,DatabaseFactory>>` class that allows to create and open a database.

[source,java]
----
DatabaseFactory databaseFactory = new DatabaseFactory("/databases/mydb");
----

Pass the path in the file system where you want the database to be stored.
In this case a new directory 'mydb' will be created under the path `/databases/` of your file system.
You can also use a relative path like `databases/mydb`.

NOTE: A `<<databasefactory,DatabaseFactory>>` object doesn't hold the `<<database-url,Database>>` instances.
It's up to you to close them once you have finished.

==== Create a new database

To create a new database from scratch, use the `.create()` method in `<<databasefactory,DatabaseFactory>>` class.
If the database already exists, an exception is thrown.

Syntax:

[source,java]
----
DatabaseFactory databaseFactory = new DatabaseFactory("/databases/mydb");
try( Database db = databaseFactory.create(); ){
  // YOUR CODE
}
----

The database instance `db` is ready to be used inside the try block.
The `<<database-url,Database>>` instance extends Java7 `AutoClosable` interface, that means the database is closed automatically when the Database variable reaches out of the scope.

==== Open an existent database

If you want to open an existent database, use the `open()` method instead:

[source,java]
----
DatabaseFactory databaseFactory = new DatabaseFactory("/databases/mydb");
try( Database db = databaseFactory.open(); ){
  // YOUR CODE
}
----

By default a database is open in `READ_WRITE` mode, but you can open it in `READ_ONLY` in this way:

[source,java]
----
databaseFactory.open(PaginatedFile.MODE.READ_ONLY);
----

Using `READ_ONLY` denys any changes to the database.
This is the suggested method if you're going to execute reads and queries only.
Or if you are opening a database from a read-only file system like a DVD or a shared read-only directory.
By letting know to ArcadeDB that you're not changing the database, a lot of optimizations will be used, like in a distributed high-available configuration a REPLICA server could be used instead of the busy MASTER.

If you open a database in READ_ONLY mode, no lock file is created, so the same database could be opened in READ_ONLY mode by another process at the same time.

==== Write your first transaction

Either if you create or open a database, in order to use it, you have to execute your code inside a transaction, in this way:

[source,java]
----
try( Database db = databaseFactory.open(); ){
  db.transaction( (tx) -> {
    // YOUR CODE HERE
  });
}
----

Using the database's auto-close and the `transaction()` method allows to forget to manage begin/commit/rollback/close operations like you would do with a normal DBMS.
Anyway, you can control the transaction with explicit methods if you prefer.
This code block is equivalent to the previous one:

[source,java]
----
Database db = databaseFactory.open();
try {
  db.begin();

  // YOUR CHANGES HERE

  db.commit();

} catch (Exception e) {
  db.rollback();
} finally {
  db.close();
}
----

Remember that every change in the database must be executed inside a transaction.
ArcadeDB is a fully transactional DBMS, ACID compliant.
The usage of transactions is like with a Relational DBMS: `.begin()` starts a new transaction and `.commit()` commits all the changes in the database unless there is an error (like a conflict on updating the same record), then the entire transaction will be automatically rollbacked and none of your changes will be in the database.
In case you want to manually rollback the transaction at a certain point (like when you have an error in your application code), you can call `.rollback()`.

Once you have your database instance (in this tutorial the variable `db` is used), you can create/update/delete records and execute queries.

==== Write your first document object

Let's start now populating the database by creating our first document of type "Customer".
What is a document?
A Document is like a map of entries.
They can be nested and entries can have different types of values, such as Strings, Integers, Floats, etc.
You can think to a document like a JSON Document but it's stored in a binary form in the database.
By the way, if you use JSON in your application, ArcadeDB provides easy API to convert a document to and from JSON.

In ArcadeDB it's mandatory to specify a type when you want tot create a document, a vertex or an edge.

Let's create the new document type "Customer" without any properties:

[source,java]
----
try( Database db = databaseFactory.open(); ){
  db.transaction( () -> {
    // CREATE THE CUSTOMER TYPE
    db.getSchema().createDocumentType("Customer");
  });
}
----

Once the "Customer" type has been created, we can create our first document:

[source,java]
----
try( Database db = databaseFactory.open(); ){
  db.transaction( () -> {
    // CREATE A CUSTOMER INSTANCE
    MutableDocument customer = db.newDocument("Customer");
    customer.set("name", "Jay");
    customer.set("surname", "Miner");
    customer.save(); // THE DOCUMENT IS SAVED IN THE DATABASE ONLY WHEN `.save()` IS CALLED
  });
}
----

You can create types and records in the same transaction.

==== Execute a Query

Once we have our database populated, how to extract data from it?
Simple, with a query.
Example of executing a prepared query:

[source,java]
----
try( Database db = databaseFactory.open(); ){
  db.transaction( () -> {
    ResultSet result = db.query("SQL", "select from V where age > ? and city = ?", 18, "Melbourne");
    while (result.hasNext()) {
      Result record = result.next();
      System.out.println( "Found record, name = " + record.getProperty("name"));
    }
  });
}
----

The first parameter of the query method is the language to be used.
In this case the common "SQL" is used.
You can also use Gremlin or other language that will be supported in the future.

The prepared statement is cached in the database, so further executions will be faster than the first one.
With prepared statements, the parameters can be passed in positional way, like in this case, or with a `Map<String,Object>` where the keys are the parameter names and the values the parameter values.
Example:

[source,java]
----
try( Database db = databaseFactory.open(); ){
  db.transaction( () -> {
    Map<String,Object> parameters = new HashMap<>();
    parameters.put( "age", 18 );
    parameters.put( "city", "Melbourne" );

    ResultSet result = db.query("SQL", "select from V where age > :age and city = :city", parameters);
    while (result.hasNext()) {
      Result record = result.next();
      System.out.println( "Found record, name = " + record.getProperty("name"));
    }
  });
}
----

By using a map, parameters are referenced by name (`:age` and `:city` in this example).

==== Create a Graph

Now that we're familiar with the most basic operations, let's see how to work with graphs.
Before creating our vertices and edges, we have to create both vertex and edge types beforehand.
In our example, we're going to create a minimal social network with "User" type for vertices and "IsFriendOf" to map the friendship relationship:

[source,java]
----
try( Database db = databaseFactory.open(); ){
  db.transaction( () -> {
    // CREATE THE ACCOUNT TYPE
    db.getSchema().createVertexType("User");
    db.getSchema().createEdgeType("IsFriendOf");
  });
}
----

Now let's create two "Profile" vertices and let's connect them with the friendship relationship "IsFriendOf", like in the chart below:

[graphviz,dot-example,svg]
----
graph g {
    Albert -- Michelle [label = "IsFriendOf" dir = "both"]
}
----

[source,java]
----
try( Database db = databaseFactory.open(); ){
  db.transaction( () -> {
    MutableVertex albert = db.newVertex("User", "name", "Albert", "lastName", "Einstein").save();
    MutableVertex michelle = db.newVertex("User", "name", "Michelle", "lastName", "Besso").save();
    albert.newEdge("IsFriendOf", michelle, true, "since", 2010);
  });
}
----

In the code snipped above, we have just created our first graph, made of 2 vertices and one edge that connects them.
Vertices and documents are not persistent until you call the `save()` method.
Note the 3rd parameter in the `newEdge()` method.
It's telling to the Graph engine that we want a bidirectional edge.
In this way, even if the direction is still from the "Albert" vertex to the "Michelle" vertex, we can traverse the edge from both sides.
Use always bidirectional unless you want to avoid creating super-nodes when it's necessary to traverse only from one side.
Note also that we stored a property "since = 2010" in the edge.
That's right, edges can have properties like vertices.

==== Traverse the Graph

What do you do with a brand new graph?
Traversing, of course!

You have basically three ways to do that (<<java-api-local,Java API>>, <<sql,SQL>>, https://tinkerpop.apache.org/[Apache Gremlin] and https://opencypher.org/[Open Cypher]) each one with its pros/cons:

[cols=5]
|===
|
|<<java-api-local,JVM Embedded API>>
|<<sql,SQL>>
|<<gremlin-api,Apache Gremlin>>
|<<open-cypher,Cypher>>

|Speed|* * *|* *|* *|* *
|Flexibility|* * *|*|* *|* *
|<<embedded-server,Embedded>> mode|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes
|Remote mode|No|Yes|Yes (through the <<gremlin-server,Gremlin Server>> plugin)|Yes (through the <<gremlin-server,Gremlin Server>> plugin)
|===

When using the API, when the SQL and Apache Gremlin?
The API is the very code based.
You have total control on the query/traversal.
With the SQL, you can combine the `SELECT` with the `MATCH` statement to create powerful traversals in a just few lines.
You could use Apache Gremlin if you're coming from another GraphDB that supports this language.

===== Traverse via API

In order to start traversing a graph, you need your root vertex (in some cases you want to start from multiple root vertices).
You can load your root vertex by its RID (Record ID), via the indexes properties or via a SQL query.

Loading a record by its RID it's the fastest way and the execution time remains constants with the growing of the database (algorithm complexity: `O(1)`).
Example of lookup by RID:

[source,java]
----
try( Database db = databaseFactory.open(); ){
  db.transaction( () -> {
    // #10:232 in our example is Albert Einstein's RID
    Vertex albert = db.lookupByRID( new RID(db, "#10:232"), true );
  });
}
----

In order to have a quick lookup, it's always suggested to create an index against one or multiple properties.
In our case, we could index the properties "name" and "lastName" with 2 separate indexes, or indeed, creating a composite index with both properties.
In this case the algorithm complexity is `O(LogN)`).
Example:

[source,java]
----
try( Database db = databaseFactory.open(); ){
  db.transaction( () -> {
    db.getSchema().createTypeIndex(SchemaImpl.INDEX_TYPE.LSM_TREE, false, "Profile", new String[] { "name", "lastName" });
  });
}
----

Now we're able to load Michelle's vertex in a flash by using this:

[source,java]
----
try( Database db = databaseFactory.open(); ){
  db.transaction( () -> {
    Vertex michelle = db.lookupByKey( "Profile", new String[]{"name", "lastName"}, new String[]{"Michelle", "Besso"} );
  });
}
----

Remember that loading a record by its RID is always faster than looking up from an index.
What about the query approach?
ArcadeDB supports SQL, so try this:

[source,java]
----
try( Database db = databaseFactory.open(); ){
  db.transaction( () -> {
    ResultSet result = db.query( "SQL", "select from Profile where name = ? and lastName = ?", "Michelle", "Besso" );
    Vertex michelle = result.next();
  });
}
----

With the query approach, if an existent index is available, then it's automatically used, otherwise a scan is executed.

Now that we have loaded the root vertex in memory, we're ready to do some traversal.
Before looking at the API, it's important to understand every edge has a direction: from vertex A to vertex B.
In the example above, the direction of the friendship is from "Albert" to "Michelle".
While in most of the cases the direction is important, sometimes, like with the friendship, it doesn't really matter the direction because if A is friend with B, it's true also the opposite.

In our example, the relationship is `Albert ---Friend---> Michelle`.
This means that if I want to retrieve all Albert's friends, I could start from the vertex "Albert" and traverse all the *outgoing* edges of type "IsFriendOf".

Instead, if I want to retrieve all Michelle's friends, I could start from Michelle as root vertex and traverse all the **incoming** edges.

In case the direction doesn't really matters (like with friendship), I could consider **both** outgoing and incoming.

So the basic traversal operations from one or more vertices, are:

- outgoing, expressed as `OUT`
- incoming, expressed as `IN`
- both, expressed as `BOTH`

In order to load Michelle's friends, this is the example by using API:

[source,java]
----
try( Database db = databaseFactory.open(); ){
  db.transaction( () -> {
    Vertex michelle; // ALREADY LOADED VIA RID, KEYS OR SQL
    Iterable<Vertex> friends = michelle.getVertices(DIRECTION.IN, "IsFriendOf" );
  });
}
----

Instead, if I start from Albert's vertex, it would be:

[source,java]
----
try( Database db = databaseFactory.open(); ){
  db.transaction( () -> {
    Vertex albert; // ALREADY LOADED VIA RID, KEYS OR SQL
    Iterable<Vertex> friends = albert.getVertices(DIRECTION.OUT, "IsFriendOf");
  });
}
----

===== Traverse via SQL

By using SQL, you can do the traversal by using SELECT:

[source,java]
----
try( Database db = databaseFactory.open(); ){
  db.transaction( () -> {
    ResultSet friends = db.query( "SQL", "SELECT expand( out('IsFriendOf') ) FROM Profile WHERE name = ? AND lastName = ?", "Michelle", "Besso" );
  });
}
----

Or with the more powerful MATCH statement:

[source,java]
----
try( Database db = databaseFactory.open(); ){
  db.transaction( () -> {
    ResultSet friends = db.query( "SQL", "MATCH {type: Profile, as: Profile, where: (name = ? and lastName = ?)}.out('IsFriendOf') {as: Friend} RETURN Friend", "Michelle", "Besso" );
  });
}
----

===== Traverse via Apache Gremlin

Since ArcadeDB is 100% compliant with Gremlin 3.7.x, you can run this query against the Apache <<gremlin-server,Gremlin Server>> configured with ArcadeDB:

[source,gremlin]
----
g.V().has('name','Michelle').has('lastName','Besso').out('IsFriendOf');
----

For more information about Apache Gremlin see: <<gremlin-api,Gremlin API>> support

===== Traverse via Open Cypher

ArcadeDB supports also Open Cypher.
The same query would be the following:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (me)-[:IsFriendOf]-(friend)
WHERE me.name = 'Michelle' and me.lastName = 'Besso'
RETURN friend.name, friend.lastName
----
