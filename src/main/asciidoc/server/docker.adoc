To run the ArcadeDB server with Docker, type this (replace <password> with the root password you want to use):

[source,shell]
----
$ docker run --rm -p 2480:2480 -p 2424:2424 --name my_arcadedb \
             --env JAVA_OPTS="-Darcadedb.server.rootPassword=playwithdata" \
             --hostname my_arcadedb arcadedata/arcadedb:latest
----

If there are no errors, Docker prints immediately the container id. You can use that id to stop the container, or execute some commands from it.

To run the console from the container started above, use:

[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ docker exec -it my_arcadedb bin/console.sh
ArcadeDB Console v.{revnumber} - Copyrights (c) 2021 Arcade Data (https://arcadedb.com)

>
----

NOTE: The ArcadeDB image can also be used with https://podman.io[Podman], just replace `docker` with `podman` in the examples.

==== Quick start with the OpenBeer database

You can run ArcadeDB server with a demo database in less than 1 minute. Run ArcadeDB server with docker specifying the database to import as a parameter in the docker command.

Example of running ArcadeDB Server with all the plugins enabled (Redis, Postgres, Mongo, Gremlin) that download and install OrientDB's `OpenBeer` dataset:

[source,shell]
----
$ docker run --rm  -p 2480:2480 -p 2424:2424 -p 6379:6379 -p 5432:5432 -p 8182:8182 --env JAVA_OPTS="\
   -Darcadedb.server.rootPassword=playwithdata \
   -Darcadedb.server.defaultDatabases=Imported[root]{import:https://github.com/ArcadeData/arcadedb-datasets/raw/main/orientdb/OpenBeer.gz} \
   -Darcadedb.server.plugins=Redis:com.arcadedb.redis.RedisProtocolPlugin, \
                             MongoDB:com.arcadedb.mongo.MongoDBProtocolPlugin, \
                             Postgres:com.arcadedb.postgres.PostgresProtocolPlugin, \
                             GremlinServer:com.arcadedb.server.gremlin.GremlinServerPlugin" \
         arcadedata/arcadedb:latest
----

Now point your browser on **http://localhost:2480** and you'll see ArcadeDB Studio. Now enter "root" as a user and "playwithdata" as a password.

NOTE: user and password are specified in the docker command above

image::../images/openbeer-demo-login.png[alt="Demo Database Login",align="center"]

Now click on the "Database" icon on the toolbar on the left. This is the database schema. Click on "OpenBeer" vertex type and then on the action "Display the first 100 records of Beer together with all the vertices that are directly connected".

image::../images/openbeer-demo-schema.png[alt="Demo Database Schema",align="center"]

You should see the first 100 beers in the database and all their connections.

==== Persistence

There are multiple options to make databases in an ArcadeDB container persistent,
yet the practical choice is highly dependent on the application and environment.

On the Docker side there are two typical options to persist data in a container:

1. A https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/[Docker volume] which is a Docker managed section of the host's filesystem. This would be the preferred option if the host machine is to store the persistent data.

2. A https://docs.docker.com/storage/bind-mounts/[Bind mount] which is a user-managed folder of the host's filesystem. This can be used if the target volume is itself mounted on the host like a network share.

See the https://docs.docker.com/storage/[Docker storage] documentation on how to set up volumes or mounts.

On the ArcadeDB side there are basically two options to consider:

1. Store the database itself on an external volume. In this case all read and write operations from and to a database take place on the specified volume or mount, which can entail performance limitations.
  Use the setting `-Darcadedb.server.databaseDirectory=/mydatabases` to specify the mount-point of the volume or mount as absolute path to ArcadeDB.

2. Store only backups on an external volume. In this approach all read and write operation from and to a database happen in the storage provided by Docker to the container. This is faster if the host can provide local storage.
  However, the user needs to take care of regular backups, see <<sql-backup-database,`BACKUP DATABASE`>>, for which the default backup folder can be set by `-Darcadedb.server.backupDirectory=/mybackup` to specify the mount-point of the volume or mount as absolute path to ArcadeDB.

NOTE: Which combination is most suitable depends on the computational environment. For example,
"local storage" can have different meanings on a bare metal machine, a virtual machine or container cluster.

==== Tuning

In general, the RAM allocated for the JVM should be â‰¤80% of the container RAM. The default Dockerfile for ArcadeDB sets 2 GB of RAM for ArcadeDB (`-Xms2G -Xmx2G`), so you should allocate at least 2.3G to the Docker container running exclusively ArcadeDB.

To run ArcadeDB with 1G docker container, you could start ArcadeDB by using 800M for ArcadeDB's server RAM by setting `ARCADEDB_OPTS_MEMORY` variable with Docker:

[source,shell]
----
$ docker ... -e ARCADEDB_OPTS_MEMORY="-Xms800M -Xmx800M" ...
----

To run ArcadeDB with RAM <800M, it's suggested to tune some settings. You can use the `low-ram` profile to use the least memory possible.

[source,shell]
----
$ docker ... -e ARCADEDB_OPTS_MEMORY="-Xms800M -Xmx800M" -e arcadedb.profile=low-ram ...
----
