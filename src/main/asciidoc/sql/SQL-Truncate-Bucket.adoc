=== SQL - `TRUNCATE BUCKET`

image:../images/edit.png[link="https://github.com/ArcadeData/arcadedb-docs/blob/main/src/main/asciidoc/sql/SQL-Truncate-Bucket.adoc" float=right]

Deletes all records of a bucket. This command operates at a lower level than the standard <<SQL-Delete,`DELETE`>> command.

Truncation is not permitted on vertex or edge typees, but you can force its execution using the `UNSAFE` keyword. Forcing truncation is strongly discouraged, as it can leave the graph in an inconsistent state.

*Syntax*

----
TRUNCATE BUCKET <bucket>

----

* *`&lt;bucket&gt;`* Defines the bucket to delete.
* *`UNSAFE`* Defines whether the command forces the truncation on vertex or edge types.

*Examples*

* Remove all records in the bucket `profile`:

----
ArcadeDB> TRUNCATE BUCKET profile
----
