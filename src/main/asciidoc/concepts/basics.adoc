### Record

Record are the smallest unit that you can load from and store in the database.
Records come in three types:

- Documents
- Vertices
- Edges

[discrete]
#### Document

Documents are softly typed and are defined by schema types, but you can also use them in a schema-less mode too.
Documents handle fields in a flexible manner.
You can easily import and export them in JSON format.
For example,

```json
{
  "name":"Jay",
  "surname":"Miner",
  "job":"Developer",
  "creations":[{
    "name":"Amiga 1000",
    "company":"Commodore Inc."
  },{
    "name":"Amiga 500",
    "company":"Commodore Inc."
  }]
}
```

[discrete]
#### Vertex

In Graph databases the vertices (also named vertexes), or nodes represent the main entity that holds the information.
It can be a Patient, a Company or a Product.
Vertices are themselves documents with some additional features.
This means they can contain embedded records and arbitrary properties exactly like documents.
Vertices are connected with other vertices through Edges.

[discrete]
#### Edge

An Edge, or Arc, is the connection between two vertices.
Edges can unidirectional and bidirectional.
One edge can only connect two vertices.

For more information on connecting vertices in general, see <<Relationships,Relationships>> below.

[[RID]]
[discrete]
#### Record ID

When ArcadeDB generates a record, it auto-assigns a unique identifier called a Record ID, RID for short.
The syntax for the RID is the pound sign with the bucket identifier, semicolon, and the position like so:

`#<bucket-identifier>:<record-position>`.

- **bucket-identifier**: This number indicates the bucket id to which the record belongs.
Positive numbers in the bucket identifier indicate persistent records. You can have up to 2,147,483,648 buckets in a database.

- **record-position**: This number defines the absolute position of the record in the bucket.

`#-1:-1` is a null RID.

NOTE: The prefix character `#` is mandatory. 

Each Record ID is immutable, universal, and is never reused. 
Additionally, records can be accessed directly through their RIDs at{nbsp}O(1){nbsp}complexity which means the query speed is constant, unaffected by database size.
For this reason, you don't need to create a field to serve as the primary key as you do in Relational databases.

[discrete]
### Types

The concept of the Type is taken from the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming[Object Oriented Programming] paradigm.
In ArcadeDB, types define records.
It is closest to the concept of a table in Relational databases.

Types can be schema-less, schema-full, or a mix. They can inherit from other types, creating a tree of types. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance_%28object-oriented_programming%29[Inheritance], in this context, means that a sub-type extends a parent type, inheriting all of its attributes.

Each type has its own <<Bucket,buckets (data files)>>.
A type can support multiple buckets.
When you execute a query against a type, it automatically fetches from all the buckets that are part of the type.
When you create a new record, ArcadeDB selects the bucket to store it in using a <<Bucket-Selection,configurable strategy>>.

As a default, ArcadeDB creates as many buckets per type as many cores(processors) the host machine has.


[discrete]
#### Types vs. Buckets in Queries

The combination of types and buckets is very powerful and has a number of use cases.Consider an example where you create a type `Invoice`,with two buckets `invoice2015` and `invoice2016`.You can query all invoices using the type as a target with[`SELECT`](../sql/SQL-Query.md).

```
arcadeDB> SELECT FROM Invoice
```

In addition to this, you can filter the result-set by year.
The type `Invoice` includes a `year` field, you can filter it through the <<SQL-Where,`WHERE`>> clause.

```
arcadeDB> SELECT FROM Invoice WHERE year=2012
```

You can also query specific objects from a single bucket.
By splitting the type `Invoice` across multiple buckets, (that is, one per year),y ou can optimize the query by narrowing the potential result-set.

```
arcadeDB> SELECT FROM BUCKET:invoice2012
```

Due to the optimization, this query runs significantly faster, because ArcadeDB can narrow the search to the targeted bucket.

[[Bucket]]
[discrete]
### Buckets

Where types provide you with a logical framework for organizing data, buckets provide physical or in-memory space in which ArcadeDB actually stores the data.
It is comparable to the collection in Document databases and the table in Relational databases. You can have up to 2,147,483,648 buckets in a database.

When you create a new type, the <<SQL-Create-Type,`CREATE TYPE`>> process also creates physical buckets that serve as the default location in which to store data for that type.
ArcadeDB forms the bucket names using the type name, with all lower case letters.
ArcadeDB creates additional buckets for each type, (one for each CPU core on the server), to improve performance of parallelism.

[[Relationships]]
[discrete]
### Relationships

ArcadeDB supports two kinds of relationships: **referenced** and **embedded**.
It can manage relationships in a schema-full or schema-less scenario.

[discrete]
#### Referenced Relationships

In Relational databases, tables are linked through `JOIN` commands, which can prove costly on computing resources.
ArcadeDB manages relationships natively without computing `JOIN`'s. Instead, it stores direct links to the target objects of the relationship. This boosts the load speed for the entire graph of connected objects, such as in Graph and Object database systems.

Example

```
Customer Record A -------------> Record B Invoice
         RID #5:23                  RID #10:2
```

[discrete]
#### Embedded Relationships

When using Embedded relationships, ArcadeDB stores the relationship within the record that embeds it.
These relationships are stronger than Reference relationships.
You can represent it as a http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_diagram#Composition[UML Composition relationship].

Embedded records do not have their own <<RID,RID>>, given that you can't directly reference it through other records.
It is only accessible through the container record.

In the event that you delete the container record, the embedded record is also deleted.
For example,

```
    Record A <>----------> Record B
   TYPE=Account          TYPE=Address
    RID #5:23               NO RID
```

Here,record `A` contains the entirety of record `B` in the property `address`.
You can reach record `B` only by traversing the container record.
For example,

```
arcadeDB> SELECT FROM Account WHERE address.city = 'Rome'
```

[discrete]
##### 1:1 and *n*:1 Embedded Relationships

ArcadeDB expresses relationships of these kinds using the `EMBEDDED` type.

[discrete]
##### 1:*n* and *n*:*n* Embedded Relationships

ArcadeDB expresses relationships of these kinds using a list or a map of links, such as:

- `LIST` An ordered list of records.
- `MAP` An ordered map of records as the value and a string as the key, it doesn't accept duplicate keys.

[discrete]
#### Inverse Relationships

In ArcadeDB, all Edges in the Graph model are bidirectional.
This differs from the Document model, where relationships are always unidirectional,requiring the developer to maintain data integrity.
In addition, ArcadeDB automatically maintains the consistency of all bidirectional relationships.

[discrete]
### Database

Each server or Java VM can handle multiple database instances,but the database name must be unique.


[[Database-URL]]
[discrete]
#### Database URL

ArcadeDB uses its own http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Locator[URL] format, of engine and database name as `<engine>:<db-name>`.
The embedded engine is the default and can be omitted.
To open a database on the local file system you can use directly the path as URL.

[discrete]
#### Database Usage

You must always close the database once you finish working on it.

NOTE: ArcadeDB automatically closes all opened databases, when the process dies gracefully (not by killing it by force).
This is assured if the Operating System allows a graceful shutdown.
