Run the console by executing `console.sh` under `bin` directory:

[source,shell]
----
~/arcadedb $ bin/console.sh

ArcadeDB Console v.23.1.1 - Copyrights (c) 2021 Arcade Data Ltd (https://arcadedb.com)

----

The console supports the following commands (you can always retrieve this help by typing `HELP` or just `?`:

[source]
----
begin                                             -> begins a new transaction
check database                                    -> check database integrity
close |<path>|remote:<url> <user> <pw>            -> closes the database
commit                                            -> commits current transaction
connect <path>|local:<url>|remote:<url> <user> <pw>            -> connects to a database
create database <path>|remote:<url> <user> <pw>   -> creates a new database
create user <user> identified by <pw> [grant connect to <db>*] -> creates a user
drop database <path>|remote:<url> <user> <pw>     -> deletes a database
drop user <user>                                  -> deletes a user
help|?                                            -> ask for this help
info types                                        -> prints available types
info transaction                                  -> prints current transaction
list databases |remote:<url> <user> <pw>          -> lists databases
load <path>                                       -> runs local script
rollback                                          -> rolls back current transaction
set language = sql|sqlscript|cypher|gremlin|mongo -> sets console query language
-- <comment>                                      -> comment (no operation)
quit|exit                                         -> exits from the console
----

NOTE: The `close` command can be used without path or url, then it closes the currently connected database.

NOTE: The `comment` command is useful for scripts.

[[Console-Tutorial]]
==== Tutorial

Let's create our first database, located in our local filesystem. To identify the database you specify in a connection string. It could be either absolute, or relative to the database directory. The database directoty can be explicitely set, when you start the console, like 

[source,shell]
----
    ./bin/console.sh -Darcadedb.server.databaseDirectory=/Users/<USER-ID>/Arcadedb
----

If no database directory is given at startup, it is the `databases` directory under the root path of the arcadedb server by default.
To create a new database under the database directory, you would run the following command in the console

[source,shell]
----
> create database mydb

{mydb}>
----

If you want to create your database somwhere else in the local filesystem, you would use an absolute path to the db, prefixed with "local:".
Like:

[source,shell]
----
> create database local://Users/<USER-ID>/Arcadedb/mydb

{mydb}
----

If you already have a database, you can simply connect to it:

[source,shell]
----
> connect mydb

{mydb}>
----

or:

[source,shell]
----
> connect local://Users/<USER-ID>/Arcadedb/mydb

{mydb}>
----

This is how you create a or connect to a database without an intermediate ArcadeDB server. 
But you can also connect to a database, which is managed by a running server:

[source,shell]
----
> connect remote:localhost/mydb root arcadedb-password
----

Let's also create a user with access to "mydb":

[source,shell]
----
> create user elon identified by muskmusk grant connect to mydb
----

Now let's create a "Profile" type:

[source]
----
{mydb}> create document type Profile

+---------+--------------------+
|NAME     |VALUE               |
+---------+--------------------+
|operation|create document type|
|typeName |Profile             |
+---------+--------------------+
Command executed in 99ms
----

Check your new type is there:

[source,shell]
----
{mydb}> info types

AVAILABLE TYPES
+-------+--------+-----------+-------------------------------------+-----------+-------------+
|NAME   |TYPE    |SUPER TYPES|BUCKETS                              |PROPERTIES |SYNC STRATEGY|
+-------+--------+-----------+-------------------------------------+-----------+-------------+
|Profile|Document|0[]        |8[Profile_0,...,Profile_7]|0[]       |round-robin|             |
+-------+--------+-----------+-------------------------------------+-----------+-------------+

----

You can also query the defined types by executing the following SQL query: `select from schema:types`.

Finally, let's create a document of type "Profile":

[source,shell]
----
{mydb}> insert into Profile set name = 'Jay', lastName = 'Miner'

DOCUMENT @type:Profile @rid:#1:0
+--------+-----+
|NAME    |VALUE|
+--------+-----+
|name    |Jay  |
|lastName|Miner|
+--------+-----+
Command executed in 17ms
----

You can see your brand new record with RID #1:0. Now let's query the database to see if our new document can be found:

[source,shell]
----
{mydb}> select from Profile

DOCUMENT @type:Profile @rid:#1:0
+--------+-----+
|NAME    |VALUE|
+--------+-----+
|name    |Jay  |
|lastName|Miner|
+--------+-----+
Command executed in 37ms
----

Here we go: our document is there.

Remember that a transaction is automatically started. In order to make changes persistent, execute a `commit` command.
When the console exists (`exit` or `quit` command), the pending transaction is committed automatically.

[[Console-Scripting]]
==== Scripting

The console can also run local SQL scripts:

[source,shell]
----
~/arcadedb $ bin/console.sh myscript.sql
----

NOTE: Make sure to `create database` or `connect` to a database first in the script before using <<SQL,SQL commands>>.
