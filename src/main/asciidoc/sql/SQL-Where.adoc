The Where condition is shared among many SQL commands.

[discrete]

==== Syntax

`[&lt;item&gt;] &lt;operator&gt; &lt;item&gt;`

[discrete]

==== Items

And `item` can be:

[%header,cols=3]
|===
|**What**|**Description**|**Example**
|field|Document field|where _price_ &gt; 1000000
|field&lt;indexes&gt;|Document field part. To know more about field part look at the full syntax: <<SQL-Bracket,Document-API-Property>>|where tags[name='Hi'] or tags[0...3] IN ('Hello') and employees IS NOT NULL
|record attribute|Record attribute name with @ as prefix|where _@type_ = 'Profile'
|any()|Represents any field of the Document. The condition is true if ANY of the fields matches the condition|where _any()_ like 'L%'
|all()|Represents all the fields of the Document. The condition is true if ALL the fields match the condition|where _all()_ is null
| <<SQL-Functions,Functions>> |Any <<SQL-Functions,Function>> between the defined ones|where distance(x, y, 52.20472, 0.14056 ) &lt;= 30
|<<Filtering,$variable>>|Context variable prefixed with $|where $depth &lt;= 3

===== Record attributes

[%header,cols=3]
|===
|Name|Description|Example
|`@this`|returns the record itself|select *@this.toJSON()* from Account
|`@rid`|returns the <<RID,RID>> in the form &lt;bucket:position&gt;. It's null for embedded records. _NOTE: using @rid in where condition slow down queries. Much better to use the <<RID,RID>> as target. Example: change this: select from Profile where @rid = #10:44 with this: select from #10:44 |**@rid** = #11:0
|`@size`|returns the record size in bytes|**@size** &gt; 1024
|`@type`|returns the record type between: 'document', 'column', 'flat', 'bytes'|**@type** = 'flat'

==== Operators

[discrete]

===== Conditional Operators

[%header,cols=4]
|===
|Apply to|Operator|Description|Example
|any|`=` or `==`|Equal to|name *=* 'Luke'
|any|`+<=>+`|Null-safe equal to, is also true if left and right operands are `null`|name *+<=>+* word
|string|LIKE|Similar to equals, but allows the wildcards '%' that means "any characters" and '?' that means "any single character". LIKE is case sensitive.|name _LIKE_ 'Luk%'
|string|ILIKE|Similar to LIKE, but ILIKE is case insensitive.|name _ILIKE_ 'lUk%'
|any|`&lt;`|Less than|age *&lt;* 40
|any|`&lt;=`|Less or equal to|age *&lt;=* 40
|any|`&gt;`|Greater than|age *&gt;* 40
|any|`&gt;=`|Greater or equal to|age *&gt;=* 40
|any|`&lt;&gt;` or `!=`|Not equal to|age *&lt;&gt;* 40
|any|BETWEEN|The value is between a range. It's equivalent to &lt;field&gt; &gt;= &lt;from-value&gt; AND &lt;field&gt; &lt;= &lt;to-value&gt;|price _BETWEEN_ 10 and 30
|any|IS|Used to test if a value is NULL|children _IS_ null
|record, string (as type name)|INSTANCEOF|Used to check if the record extends a type|@this _INSTANCEOF_ 'Customer' or @type _INSTANCEOF_ 'Provider'
|collection|IN|contains any of the elements listed|name _IN_ ['European','Asiatic']
|collection|CONTAINS|true if the collection contains at least one element that satisfy the next condition. Condition can be a single item: in this case the behaviour is like the IN operator|children _CONTAINS_ (name = 'Luke') - map.values() _CONTAINS_ (name = 'Luke')
|collection|CONTAINSALL|true if all the elements of the collection satisfy the next condition|children _CONTAINSALL_ (name = 'Luke')
|collection|CONTAINSANY|true if any the elements of the collection satisfy the next condition|children _CONTAINSANY_ (name = 'Luke')
|map|CONTAINSKEY|true if the map contains at least one key equals to the requested. You can also use map.keys() CONTAINS in place of it|connections _CONTAINSKEY_ 'Luke'
|map|CONTAINSVALUE|true if the map contains at least one value equals to the requested. You can also use map.values() CONTAINS in place of it|connections _CONTAINSVALUE_ 10:3
|string|CONTAINSTEXT| When used against an indexed field, a lookup in the index will be performed with the text specified as key. When there is no index a simple Java indexOf will be performed. So the result set could be different if you have an index or not on that field |text _CONTAINSTEXT_ 'jay'
|string|MATCHES|Matches the string using a http://www.regular-expressions.info/[Regular Expression]|text _MATCHES_ `\b[A-Z0-9.%+-]+@[A-Z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z]{2,4}\b`
|===

[discrete]

===== Logical Operators

[%header,cols=3]
|===
|Operator|Description|Example
|AND|true if both the conditions are true|name = 'Luke' *and* surname like 'Sky%'
|OR|true if at least one of the condition is true|name = 'Luke' *or* surname like 'Sky%'
|NOT|true if the condition is false. NOT needs parenthesis on the right with the condition to negate|**not** ( name = 'Luke')

===== Mathematics Operators

[%header,cols=4]
|===
|Apply to|Operator|Description|Example
|Numbers|+|Plus|`age + 34`
|Numbers|-|Minus|`salary - 34`
|Numbers|*|Multiply|`factor * 1.3`
|Numbers|/|Divide|`total / 12`
|Numbers|%|Mod|`total % 3`

Also called "Field Operators", are <<SQL-Methods,SQL-Methods>>.

==== Variables

ArcadeDB supports variables managed in the context of the command/query. By default, some variables are created. Below the table with the available variables:

[%header,cols=3]
|===
|Name |Description |Command(s)
|`$parent`|Get the parent context from a sub-query. Example: `select from V let $type = ( traverse * from $parent.$current.children )`|<<SQL-Select,SELECT>> and <<SQL-Traverse,TRAVERSE>>
|`$current`|Current record to use in sub-queries to refer from the parent's variable|<<SQL-Select,SELECT>> and <<SQL-Traverse,TRAVERSE>>
|`$depth`|The current depth of nesting|<<SQL-Traverse,TRAVERSE>>
|`$path`|The string representation of the current path. Example: `#6:0.in.#5:0#.out`. You can also display it with `select $path from (traverse * from V)`|<<SQL-Traverse,TRAVERSE>>
|`$stack`|The List of operation in the stack. Use it to access to the history of the traversal|<<SQL-Traverse,TRAVERSE>>
|`$history`|The set of all the records traversed as a `Set&lt;RID&gt;`|<<SQL-Traverse,TRAVERSE>>
|===

To set custom variable use the <<SQL-LET,LET>> keyword.

==== Wildcards

[%header,cols=3]
|===
|Symbol |Description |Example
|`%` |Matches all strings that contain an unknown substring of any length at the position of `%` |"%DB" "A%DB" "Arcade%" all match "ArcadeDB"
|`?` |Matches all strings that contain an unknown character at the position of `?` |"N?SQL" matches "NoSQL" but not "NewSQL"
|===

Filtering for strings containing wildcards characters can be done by escaping with backslash, i.e. `\%`, `\?`.
