==== SQL - `CREATE TYPE`
image:../images/edit.png[link="https://github.com/ArcadeData/arcadedb-docs/blob/main/src/main/asciidoc/query-languages/sql/sql-create-type.adoc" float=right]

Creates a new type in the schema.

*Syntax*

[source,sql]
----
CREATE <DOCUMENT|VERTEX|EDGE> TYPE <type> 
[UNIDIRECTIONAL] [ IF NOT EXISTS ]
[EXTENDS <super-type>] [BUCKET <bucket-id>[,]*] [BUCKETS <total-bucket-number>]

----

* Use *`&lt;DOCUMENT|VERTEX|EDGE&gt;`* if you are creating respectively a document, vertex or edge type.
* *`&lt;type&gt;`* Defines the name of the type you want to create. You must use a letter, underscore or dollar for the first character,
 for all other characters you can use alphanumeric characters, underscores and dollar.
* *UNIDIRECTIONAL* Defines an edge types (only) to be of single direction instead of the default bi-directional edge.
* *IF NOT EXISTS* Specifying this option, the type creation will just be ignored if the type already exists (instead of failing
 with an error)
* *`&lt;super-type&gt;`* Defines the super-type you want to extend with this type.
* *`&lt;bucket-id&gt;`* Defines in a comma-separated list the ID's of the buckets you want this type to use.
* *`&lt;total-bucket-number&gt;`* Defines the total number of buckets you want to create for this type. The default value is `1`.

In the event that a bucket of the same name exists in the bucket, the new type uses this bucket by default. If you do not define a
bucket in the command and a bucket of this name does not exist, ArcadeDB creates one. The new bucket has the same name as the type,
but in lower-case.

When working with multiple cores, it is recommended that you use multiple buckets to improve concurrency during inserts. To change
the number of buckets created by default, <<sql-alter-database,`ALTER DATABASE`>> command to update the `minimumbuckets` property.
You can also define the number of buckets you want to create using the `BUCKETS` option when you create the type.

*Examples*

* Create the document type `Account`:

----
ArcadeDB> CREATE DOCUMENT TYPE Account
----

* Create the vertex type `Car` to extend `Vehicle`:

----
ArcadeDB> CREATE VERTEX TYPE Car EXTENDS Vehicle
----

* Create the vertex type `Car`, using the bucket with name 'Car_classic' and 'Car_modern':

----
ArcadeDB> CREATE VERTEX TYPE Car BUCKET Car_classic,Car_modern
----

*Bucket Selection Strategies*

When you create a type, it inherits the bucket selection strategy defined at the database-level. By default, this is set to
`round-robin`. You can change the database default using the <<sql-alter-database,`ALTER DATABASE`>> command and the selection
strategy for the type using the <<sql-alter-type,`ALTER TYPE`>> command.

Supported Strategies:

[%header,cols=2]
|===
| Strategy | Description
| `round-robin` | Selects the next bucket in a circular order, restarting once complete.
| `thread` | Selects the next bucket by using the partition (mod) from the current thread id. This strategy gives the best results in terms of performance if you are using multiple threads and multiple buckets.
| `partitioned(<primary-key>)` | Uses the primary key to assign a partition to the record. This allows to speedup the lookup into the index avoiding to search for a key in all the sub-indexes. Use this if you have multiple buckets and you want fast lookup but slower insertions.
