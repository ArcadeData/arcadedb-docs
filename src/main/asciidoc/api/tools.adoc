=== Compatible Tools

==== G.V() [gdotv]

ArcadeDB is fully compatible to https://gdotv.com/[G.V()], thus no particular configurations need to be made.
The only requirement is loading the Gremlin plugin via the server setting:
```
"-Darcadedb.server.plugins=GremlinServer:com.arcadedb.server.gremlin.GremlinServerPlugin"
```

On the title screen, create a new connection:

enter the host name of the ArcadeDB server:

image::../images/gdotv-connect.png[]

and enter username and password:

In case of non-standard configurations of the server, under "Advanced Settings"
more fine-grained settings can be made.

==== JetBrains DataGrip/Database Plugin

Connecting via https://www.jetbrains.com/datagrip/[JetBrains DataGrid] database plugin is relatively straightforward.
The introspection features aren't working yet, but the basics seem to work well.

[%collapsible]
====

To connect, create a new Postgres datasource and point it to the IP/port of your ArcadeDb server. (0.0.0.0:5432 by default) You will need to fill out the database field, or you'll get an error on connection.
At present, changing the current database requires editing the datasource.

Next, you'll need to set `preferQueryMode` to *simple* on the Advanced tab, like this:

You can then run queries via a console.
Even non-SQL queries will work, though expect squigglies!

====

==== DBeaver

The universal database tool https://dbeaver.io[DBeaver] has basic compatibility via the legacy Postgres connector.

[%collapsible]
====

Create a new connection with the "PostgreSQL (Old)" driver:

image::../images/dbeaver-driver.png[]

Add your host, port, database, username and password to the general connection settings:

image::../images/dbeaver-settings.png[]

Set the `preferQueryMode` option to `simple` on "Driver Properties" tab:

image::../images/dbeaver-option1.png[]

Set the `sslmode` option to `disable`:

image::../images/dbeaver-option2.png[]

The "Finish" the connection wizard and double click the created connection to connect.
Then with a right-click the SQL console can be started:

image::../images/dbeaver-console.png[]

Now the SQL console can be used to communicate via DBeaver with ArcadeDB.

Note that this is only a basic support using a generic relational driver for a NoSQL database,
so various functionalities can reslt in errors.

====

==== DbVisualizer

The database client https://www.dbvis.com[DbVisualizer] can also be used via its PostgreSQL driver.

[%collapsible]
====

Create a new connection and select "PostgreSQL":

image::../images/dbvisualizer-create.png[]

Enter server, port, database, userid, and password:

image::../images/dbvisualizer-connection.png[]

Go to the "Properties" tab and set `preferQueryMode` to `simple`:

image::../images/dbvisualizer-settings1.png[]

Also set `sslmode` to `disable`:

image::../images/dbvisualizer-settings2.png[]

After applying the changes and connecting the SQL commander is available:

====

==== LibreOffice Base

There is minimal support for ArcadeDB in https://www.libreoffice.org/discover/base/[LibreOffice Base] via a PostgreSQL connection:

[%collapsible]
====

Select "Connect to existing database" and choose "PostgreSQL"

image::../images/libreoffice-select.png[]

Enter the postgres protocol connection string (without username and password), for example:
`postgres://localhost:5432/dbname`

image::../images/libreoffice-settings.png[]

Enter the user name and check that a password is required (try with the "Test Connection" button)

image::../images/libreoffice-authentication.png[]

Choose if you want to register the database in LibreOffice, select to open for editing, and "Finish" the wizard.

image::../images/libreoffice-proceed.png[]

Now, in the menu under "Tools" -> "SQL..." queries and commands can be send to ArcadeDB.

image::../images/libreoffice-execute.png[]

Make sure that "Run SQL command directly" is selected, and to view results check "Show output  ..."
