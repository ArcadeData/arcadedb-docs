==== SQL - `REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW`
image:../images/edit.png[link="https://github.com/ArcadeData/arcadedb-docs/blob/main/src/main/asciidoc/query-languages/sql/sql-refresh-materialized-view.adoc" float=right]

Triggers an immediate full refresh of a materialized view's data.
The operation truncates all existing data in the backing type and reloads it by re-executing the defining query.
The refresh runs inside its own transaction.

This command is useful for `MANUAL` refresh mode views and for recovering a `STALE` view after a failed automatic refresh.

*Syntax*

[source,sql]
----
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW <name>
----

* *`<name>`* The name of the materialized view to refresh.

*Examples*

* Refresh a view immediately:

[source,sql]
----
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW HourlySummary
----

* Refresh after a bulk import to bring a manual view up to date:

[source,sql]
----
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW SalesByProduct
----
