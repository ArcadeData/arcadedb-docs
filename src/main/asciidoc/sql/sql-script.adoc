=== SQL Script

image:../images/edit.png[link="https://github.com/ArcadeData/arcadedb-docs/blob/main/src/main/asciidoc/sql/sql-script.adoc" float=right]

ArcadeDB allows execution of arbitrary scripts written in Javascript or any scripting language installed in the JVM.

ArcadeDB supports a minimal SQL engine to allow a batch of commands, called "SQL Script" (`sqlscript`).
Batches of commands are useful when you have to execute multiple things at the server side and avoiding the network roundtrip for each command.

The following list highlights the differences between `sql` and `sqlscript`:

* `sqlscript` allows multiple statements, `sql` is limited to a single statement.
* A `sqlscript` batch is automatically transaction, a `sql` query or command by itself is not.
* `sqlscript` supports additional control flow constructs (i.e. loops and conditionals, see below).

NOTE: Given that `sqlscript` always induces transactions,
      the transaction atomicity prerequisite of "all-or-nothing" applies to every `sqlscript` script.

SQL Script supports all the ArcadeDB <<sql-commands,SQL Commands>>, plus the following:

* `BEGIN [isolation &lt;isolation-level&gt;]`, where `&lt;isolation-level&gt;` can be `READ_COMMITTED`, `REPEATABLE_READ`. By default is `READ_COMMITTED`
* `COMMIT [retry &lt;retry&gt;]`, where:
** `&lt;retry&gt;` is the number of retries in case of concurrent modification exception
* `ROLLBACK` 
* `LET &lt;variable&gt; = &lt;SQL&gt;`, to assign the result of a SQL command to a variable. To reuse the variable prefix it with the dollar sign `$`.

NOTE: A `LET` can be used as an ephemeral https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/View_(SQL)[view].

NOTE: `LET`-declared variables have dynamic scope.

* `IF(&lt;condition&gt;){ &lt;statememt&gt;; [&lt;statement&gt;;]* }`. Look at <<conditional-execution,conditional execution>>.
* `WHILE(&lt;condition&gt;){ &lt;statememt&gt;; [&lt;statement&gt;;]* }`. Look at <<loops,loops>>.
* `FOREACH(&lt;variable&gt; IN &lt;expression&gt;){ &lt;statememt&gt;; [&lt;statement&gt;;]* }`. Look at <<loops,loops>>.
* `SLEEP &lt;ms&gt;`, put the batch in wait for `&lt;ms&gt;` milliseconds.
////
* `console.log &lt;text&gt;`, logs a message in the console. Context variables can be used with `${&lt;variable&gt;}`.
* `console.error &lt;text&gt;`, writes a message in the console's standard output. Context variables can be used with `${&lt;variable&gt;}`.
* `console.output &lt;text&gt;`, writes a message in the console's standard error. Context variables can be used with `${&lt;variable&gt;}`.
////
* `BREAK` Look at <<loops,loops>>.
* `RETURN <value>`, where `value` can be:
** any value. Example: `return 3`
** any variable with `$` as prefix. Example: `return $a`
** arrays (HTTP protocol only, see below). Example: `return [ $a, $b ]`
** maps (HTTP protocol only, see below). Example: `return { &#39;first&#39; : $a, &#39;second&#39; : $b }`
** a query. Example: `return (SELECT FROM Foo)`

NOTE: An empty result can be returned via `RETURN []` in SQLscript and also SQL.

NOTE: to return arrays and maps (eg. Java or Node.js driver) it's strongly recommended using a RETURN SELECT, eg. 

----
RETURN (SELECT $a as first, $b as second)
----

This will work on any protocol and driver.

*Optimistic transaction*

Example to create a new vertex in a <<transactions,Transactions>> and attach it to an existent vertex by creating a new edge between them. If a concurrent modification occurs, repeat the transaction up to 100 times:

[source,sql]
----
begin;
let account = create vertex Account set name = 'Luke';
let city = select from City where name = 'London';
let e = create edge Lives from $account to $city;
commit retry 100;
return $e;
----

Note the usage of `$account` and `$city` in further SQL commands.

[[conditional-execution]]
*Conditional execution*

SQL Batch provides IF constructor to allow conditional execution.
The syntax is

[source,sql]
----
IF( <sql-predicate> ){
  <statement>;
  <statement>;
  ...
}
----

WARNING: There has to be a linebreak after `IF( <sql-predicate> ){` and `}` has to follow a linebreak.

`&lt;sql-predicate&gt;` is any valid SQL predicate (any condition that can be used in a `WHERE` clause):

[source,sql]
----
IF( $a.size() > 0 ) {
  ROLLBACK;
}
----

[[loops]]
*Loops*

SQL Batch provides two different loop blocks: `FOREACH` and `WHILE`.

[discrete]
==== FOREACH

Loops on all the items of a collection and, for each of them, executes a set of SQL statements.
The expression argument should return an array, and can be a literal array, variable, or result of a sub-query.

The syntax is:

[source,sql]
----
FOREACH( <variable> IN <expression> ){
   <statement>;
   <statement>;
   ...
}
----

Example

[source,sql]
----
FOREACH( $i IN [1, 2, 3] ){
  INSERT INTO Foo SET value = $i;
}
----

[discrete]
==== WHILE

Loops while a condition is true.

The syntax is:

[source,sql]
----
WHILE( <condition> ){
   <statement>;
   <statement>;
   ...
}
----

Example

[source,sql]
----
LET $i = 0;
WHILE ($i < 10){
  INSERT INTO Foo SET value = $i;
  LET $i = $i + 1;
}
----

[discrete]
==== BREAK

`FOREACH` and `WHILE` loops can be conditionally interrupted using `BREAK`.

[source,sql]
----
FOREACH( $i IN [1, 2, 3] ){
  IF( $i >2 ){
    BREAK;
  }
  CONSOLE.log $i;
}
----

Example that computes the sum of amounts for customers until the amount is negative.

[source,sql]
----
LET total = 0;
FOREACH( $record IN (select from CustomerAccount) ){
  IF( record.amount < 0 ) {
    BREAK;
  }
  LET total = $total + record.amount;
}
RETURN $total;
----
