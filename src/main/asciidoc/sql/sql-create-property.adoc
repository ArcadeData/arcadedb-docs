=== SQL - `CREATE PROPERTY`

image:../images/edit.png[link="https://github.com/ArcadeData/arcadedb-docs/blob/main/src/main/asciidoc/sql/sql-create-property.adoc" float=right]

Creates a property in the schema.

*Syntax*

[source,sql]
----
CREATE PROPERTY <class>.<property> <type> [ <link-type> ]
[ IF NOT EXISTS ]
[ <property-constraint> ]
----

Where:
 
* *`&lt;class&gt;`* Defines the class to which you want to add a property.
* *`&lt;property&gt;`* Defines name you want to give to the property.
* *`&lt;type&gt;`* Defines the property's data type. See below for supported types.
* *`&lt;link-type&gt;`* Optional. Defines the contained type for container types, such as collection lists, maps and sets. If you create the property with a data type of LIST, SET or MAP, you can also define the linked type contained by the collection. For instance:
** `LIST<STRING>` Defines a property as a list that contains strings.
** `SET<LONG>` Defines a property as a set that contains long integers.
** `MAP<STRING, INTEGER>` Defines a property as a map with string keys and integer values.
* *`IF NOT EXISTS`* Optional. Property creation is not executed if already exists (instead of failing)
* *`&lt;property-constraint&gt;`* Optional. Defines the specific property constraints, such as `MANDATORY` and/or `READONLY`:

[source,sql]
----
[ MANDATORY <true|false> ]
[ READONLY <true|false> ]
[ DEFAULT <value> ]
[ MIN <value> ]
[ MAX <value> ]
[ REGEXP <expression> ]
----

*Supported Data Types*

ArcadeDB supports the following data types for property values:
 
* `BOOLEAN` Defines a property that can only take the values `true` or `false`.
* `INTEGER` Defines a property that can only take as values integers. In Java, this is mapped to the `int` data type.
* `SHORT` Defines a property that can only take as values short integers. In Java, this is mapped to the `short` data type. In JavaScript and some other languages, numbers are always `double` floating-point variables.
* `LONG` Defines a property that can only take as values long integers. In Java, this is mapped to the `long` data type. In JavaScript and other languages, numbers are always `double` floating-point variables.
* `FLOAT` Defines a property that can only take floating-point values. In Java, this is mapped to the `float` data type. In JavaScript and other languages, numbers are always `double` floating-point variables.
* `DOUBLE` Defines a property that can only take floating-point values. In Java, this is mapped to the `double` data type.
* `DATETIME` Defines a property that can only take date values. In Java, this is mapped to the `Date` data type.
* `STRING` Defines a property that can only take string values. In Java, this is mapped to the `String` data type.
* `BINARY` Defines a property that can only take binary values. In Java, this is mapped to the `byte[]` data type.
* `EMBEDDED` Defines a property that can only take a document embedded in the document. Object types are string, maps, lists, and vectors (see below).
* `VECTOR` Defines a vector of numbers. In Java, this is mapped to the 'VectorDetail' data type.
* `EMBEDDED MAP` Defines a property that takes values of the embedded map type, that is, mapping of strings to values. In Java, this is mapped to the `Map<String, T>` data type, where `T` is any other data type.
* `EMBEDDED LIST` Defines a property that takes values of the embedded list type, that is, a list of elements of a single data type. In Java, this is mapped to the `List<T>` data type, where `T` is any other data type.
* `EMBEDDED SET` Defines a property that takes values of the embedded set type, that is, a set of elements of a single data type. In Java, this is mapped to the `Set<T>` data type, where `T` is any other data type.
* `LINK` Defines a property that takes values as links to documents of a different class.
* `LINK MAP` Defines a property that takes values of the link map type, that is, a mapping of strings to links to documents of a different class.
* `LINK LIST` Defines a property that takes values of the link list type, that is, a list of links to documents of a different class.
* `LINK SET` Defines a property that takes values of the link set type, that is, a set of links to documents of a different class. In Java, this is mapped to the `Set<T>` data type, where T is a link.
* Any class type, including "V", "E" for Graphs.

*Examples*

* Create a property using the default settings:

```java
ArcadeDB> CREATE PROPERTY User.name STRING
```

* Create a 'tags' property as a list of strings:

```java
ArcadeDB> CREATE PROPERTY Post.tags LIST<STRING>
```

* Create an 'email' property for the 'Account' class with the 'MANDATORY' constraint set:

```java
ArcadeDB> CREATE PROPERTY Account.email STRING MANDATORY true
```

* Create a complex property with multiple constraints:

```java
ArcadeDB> CREATE PROPERTY Account.id LONG MANDATORY true READONLY true DEFAULT "sequence('accounts').next()"
```

* Create a property that must match a regular expression:

```java
ArcadeDB> CREATE PROPERTY Account.gender STRING REGEXP "[mf]"
```

* Create a new property on a vertex class:

```java
ArcadeDB> CREATE PROPERTY V.createDate DATETIME DEFAULT "sysdate()"
```
