### Command

The first and most important panel in Studio is the Command panel.
Below you can find a screenshot with the main components.

* *Main Menu* is the vertical tab with the following options:
** *Command*, the current panel to execute commands against the database
** *Database*, containing the information about the selected database and its schema.
From this panel you can switch to a different database
** *API*, with the description of the public HTTP API exposed on the current server
** *Information*, containing a quick reference to the online documentation

#### Execute a command/query

In order to execute a command (or query), select the language first. By default is SQL, but you can choose between:

* *SQL* (for any models, including graphs and documents)
* *Apache Tinkerpop Gremlin* (only for graphs)
* *Open Cypher* (only for graphs)
* *MongoDB* (only for documents)

Based on the selected language, the command text area will adjust the syntax highlighting to simplify the writing of the command.

Coming Soon.
