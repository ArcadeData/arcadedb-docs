Removes a materialized view and its backing document type, including all stored data.

*Syntax*

[source,sql]
----
DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW [IF EXISTS] <name>
----

* *`<name>`* The name of the materialized view to remove.
* *`IF EXISTS`* Suppresses errors when the view does not exist.

*Examples*

* Drop a materialized view:

[source,sql]
----
DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW ActiveUsers
----

* Drop a view only if it exists:

[source,sql]
----
DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW IF EXISTS NonExistentView
----

NOTE: You cannot drop the backing document type of a materialized view directly using `DROP TYPE`. Drop the materialized view first.
