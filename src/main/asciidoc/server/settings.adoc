To change the default value of a setting, always put `arcadedb.` as a prefix. Example:

[source,shell]
----
~/arcadedb $ java -Darcadedb.dumpConfigAtStartup=true ...
----

To change the same setting via Java code:

[source,java]
----
GlobalConfiguration.findByKey("arcadedb.dumpConfigAtStartup").setValue(true);
----

Check the <<Settings,Appendix>> for all the available settings.

==== RAM Configuration

ArcadeDB Server, by default, uses a dynamic allocation for the used RAM. Sometimes you want to limit this to a specific amount. You can define the environment variable `ARCADEDB_OPTS_MEMORY` to the JVM settings for the usage of the RAM.

Example to use 800M fixed RAM for ArcadeDB Server:


[source,shell]
----
export ARCADEDB_OPTS_MEMORY="-Xms800M -Xmx800M"
bin/server.sh
----

ArcadeDB can run with as little as 16 MB for RAM. In case you're running ArcadeDB with less than 800M of RAM, you should set the "low-ram" as profile:

[source,shell]
----
export ARCADEDB_OPTS_MEMORY="-Xms128M -Xmx128M"
bin/server.sh -Darcadedb.profile=low-ram
----

Setting a profile is like executing a macro that changes multiple settings at once. You can tune them individually, check <<Settings,Settings>>.

In case of memory latency problems under Linux systems, the following JVM setting can improve performance:

[source,shell]
----
export ARCADEDB_OPTS_MEMORY="-XX:+PerfDisableSharedMem"
----

The Java heap memory is by default configured for desktop use;
for custom containers, memory configuration can be adapted by:

[source,shell]
----
export ARCADEDB_OPTS_MEMORY="-XX:InitialRAMPercentage=50.0 -XX:MaxRAMPercentage=75.0"
----
