ArcadeDB is able to import a database exported from Neo4j in JSONL format (one json per line).

To export a Neo4j database follow the instructions in https://neo4j.com/labs/apoc/4.3/export/json/[Export in JSON].
The resulting file contains one json per line.

Neo4j supports multiple labels per node, while in ArcadeDB a node (vertex) must have only one type.
The Neo4j importer will simulate multiple labels by creating new types with the following name: `<label1>[_<labelN>]*`.
Example:

```json
{"type":"node","id":"1","labels":["User", "Administrator"],"properties":{"name":"Jim","age":42}}
```

This vertex will be created in ArcadeDB with type "Administrator_User" (the labels are always sorted alphabetically) that extends both "Administrator" and "User" types.

----
graph g {
    "Administrator_User" -- "Administrator"
    "Administrator_User" -- "User"
}
----

In this way you can use the polymorphism of ArcadeDB to retrieve all the nodes of type "User" and the record of User and all its subtypes will be returned.

**Example**

Example of importing the following mini graph exported from Neo4j.
This is the example taken from Neo4j documentation about Export to JSON.

```json
{"type":"node","id":"0","labels":["User"],"properties":{"born":"2015-07-04T19:32:24","name":"Adam","place":{"crs":"wgs-84","latitude":33.46789,"longitude":13.1,"height":null},"age":42,"male":true,"kids":["Sam","Anna","Grace"]}}
{"type":"node","id":"1","labels":["User"],"properties":{"name":"Jim","age":42}}
{"type":"node","id":"2","labels":["User"],"properties":{"age":12}}
{"id":"0","type":"relationship","label":"KNOWS","properties":{"since":1993,"bffSince":"P5M1DT12H"},"start":{"id":"0","labels":["User"]},"end":{"id":"1","labels":["User"]}}
```

As you can see, the file contains one json per line.
First all the nodes (vertices), then the relationships (edges).

To import a database use the <<SQL-Import-Database,Import Database>> command from API, Studio or Console. Below you can find an example of importing the Neo4j's PanamaPapers database by using ArcadeDB <<Console,Console>>.

```shell
~/arcadedb $ create database PanamaPapers
~/arcadedb $ import database file:///temp/panama-papers-neo4j.jsonl
