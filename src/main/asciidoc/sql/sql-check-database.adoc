=== SQL - `CHECK DATABASE`

image:../images/edit.png[link="https://github.com/ArcadeData/arcadedb-docs/blob/main/src/main/asciidoc/sql/sql-Check-Database.adoc" float=right]

Executes an integrity check and in case of a repair of the database. This command analyzes the following things:

* buckets: all the pages and records are scanned and checked if can be loaded (no physical corruption)
* vertices: all the vertices are loaded and all the connected edges are checked. In case some edges point to records that have been
 deleted they can be fixed automatically if the `FIX` option is enabled.
* edges: scan all the edges and check the incoming and outgoing links are consistent in the relative vertices. If not, the edges can
 be automatically removed if the `FIX` option is enabled.

*Syntax*

[source,sql]
----
CHECK DATABASE [ TYPE <type-name>[,]* ] [ BUCKET <bucket-name>[,]* ] [ FIX ] [ COMPRESS ]
----

* *`&lt;type-name&gt;`* Optional, if specified limit the check (and the fix) only to the specific types
* *`&lt;bucket-name&gt;`* Optional, if specified limit the check (and the fix) only to the specific buckets
* *`FIX`* Optional, if used auto fix the issue found with the check
* *`COMPRESS`* Optional, if used compresses the database with the check  

The command returns the integrity check report in one record with the fields:

[cols="1,3",options="header"]
|===
| *Field* | *Description*
| `avgPageUsed` | average space used in a page.
                  This is a percentage value, where 100% means all the pages are full.
                  If a record is too big, a page is split into multiple pages and multiple reads are necessary.
                  Sometimes it helps to create buckets with larger pages to accommodate large records,
                  see the <<Settings,`bucketDefaultPageSize`>> setting.
| `warnings` | set of warning messages. 
| `totalSurrogateRecords` | number of records that have been moved between pages.
                            This happens when a record is updated and doesn't fit the original page,
                            so a surrogate (placeholder) is set to point to the new page/position or it's a piece of a record stored on multiple pages. Internal, can be ignored.
| `totalPlaceholderRecords` | see above. Internal, can be ignored. 
| `pageSize` | internal, can be ignored.
| `totalDeletedRecords` | number of records deleted in the database (allocated minus active).
                          When a record is deleted, it's RID is not recycled!
| `totalAllocatedRecords` | total number of records created in the database.
                            A record can be of type document, vertex or edge.
| `totalAllocatedDocuments` | see above, but only documents records.
| `totalAllocatedVertices` | see above, but only vertex records.
| `totalAllocatedEdges` | see above, but only edge records.
| `totalActiveRecords` | total number of records that are "active" (not deleted).
                         A record can be of type document, vertex or edge.
| `totalActiveDocuments` | see above, but only vertex document.                       
| `totalActiveVertices` | see above, but only vertex records.
| `totalActiveEdges` | see above, but only edge records.
| `totalMaxOffset` | internal, can be ignored.
| `deletedRecordsAfterFix` | holds the list of RIDs deleted after a fix.
| `corruptedRecords` | all the records not found in the database.
                       This could happen with broken edges (edges pointing to deleted vertices).
                       This should be zero; if not, it means there is a bug in the graph operations that doesn't keep operations 100% transactional. Please report this.
| `totalPages` | total number of pages in the database.
| `rebuiltIndexes` | list of indexes that have been rebuilt automatically if corrupted records were found.
| `operation` | can be ignored, set by the console.
| `invalidLinks` | similar to corrupted records; should be zero.
| `totalErrors` | counter of errors encountered while checking the database.
             It should be zero.
| `autoFix` | counter of autofix operations executed by the check database under the hood when corrupted records have been encountered. 
              Some operations, like broken edges, can be fixed and restored automatically.

*Examples*

* Execute the integrity check of the entire database without fixing any issue found.

----
ArcadeDB> CHECK DATABASE
----

* Execute the integrity check of the types 'Account' and 'Bill' without fixing any issue found.

----
ArcadeDB> CHECK DATABASE TYPE Account, Bill
----

* Execute the integrity check only on the bucket 'Account_Europe' without fixing any issue found.

----
ArcadeDB> CHECK DATABASE BUCKET Account_Europe
----

* Execute the integrity check of the entire database and auto fix any issues found.

----
ArcadeDB> CHECK DATABASE FIX
