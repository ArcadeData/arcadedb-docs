The `+WHERE+` condition is shared among many SQL commands.
A condition results in a boolean; and a compound condition,
consisting of multiple conditions that are combined with logical operators,
is resolved from left to right.


[discrete]

==== Syntax

`[&lt;item&gt;] &lt;operator&gt; &lt;item&gt;`

[discrete]

==== Items

And `item` can be:

[%header,cols=3]
|===
|**What**|**Description**|**Example**
|field|Document field|`+WHERE price > 1000000+`
|field&lt;indexes&gt;|Document field part. To know more about field part look at the full syntax: <<sql-bracket,Document-API-Property>>|`+WHERE tags[name='Hi'] OR tags[0...3] IN ('Hello') AND employees IS NOT NULL+`
|record attribute|Record attribute name with `+@+` as prefix|`+WHERE @type = 'Profile'+`
// |any()|Represents any field of the Document. The condition is true if ANY of the fields matches the condition|where _any()_ like 'L%'
// |all()|Represents all the fields of the Document. The condition is true if ALL the fields match the condition|where _all()_ is null
| <<sql-functions,Functions>> |Any <<sql-functions,Function>> between the defined ones|`+WHERE distance(x, y, 52.20, 0.14) <= 30+`
|`+$variable+`|Context variable prefixed with `+$+`|`+WHERE $depth <= 3+`
|===

[discrete]

===== Record attributes

[%header,cols=3]
|===
|Name|Description|Example
|`+@this+`|returns the record itself|`+SELECT @this.toJSON() FROM Account+`
|`+@rid+`|returns the <<rid,RID>> in the form `+bucket:position+`. It is null for embedded records. _NOTE:_ using `+@rid+` in a "Where" condition slows down queries. Much better to use the <<rid,RID>> as target. Example: change `+SELECT FROM Profile WHERE @rid = #10:44+` to `+SELECT FROM #10:44+` |`+@rid = #11:0+`
|`+@size+`|returns the record size in bytes|`+@size > 1024+`
|`+@type+`|returns the record type between: 'document', 'column', 'flat', 'bytes'|`+@type = 'flat'+`

==== Operators

[discrete]

===== Conditional Operators

[%header,cols=4]
|===
|Apply to|Operator|Description|Example
|any|`+=+` or `+==+`|Equals|`+name = 'Luke'+`
|any|`+<=>+`|Null-safe-equals, is also true if left and right operands are `+NULL+`|`+name <=> word+`
|string|`+LIKE+`|Similar to equals, but allows the wildcards '`+%+`' that means "any characters" and '`+?+`' that means "any single character". `+LIKE+` is case sensitive. Does not use index!|`+name LIKE 'Luk%'+`
|string|`+ILIKE+`|Similar to `+LIKE+`, but `+ILIKE+` is case insensitive.|`+name ILIKE 'lUk%'+`
|any|`+<+`|Less than|`+age < 40+`
|any|`+<=+`|Less or equal to|`+age <= 40+`
|any|`+>+`|Greater than|`+age > 40+`
|any|`+>=+`|Greater or equal to|`+age >= 40+`
|any|`+<>+` or `+!=+`|Not equal to|`+age <> 40+`
|any|`+BETWEEN+`|The value is between a range. It's equivalent to `+<field> >= <from-value> AND <field> <= <to-value>+`|`+price BETWEEN 10 AND 30+`
|any|`+IS+`|Used to test if a value is `+NULL+`|`+children IS NULL+`
|any|`+IS NOT+`|Used to test if a value is not `+NULL+`|`+children IS NOT NULL+`
|record, string (as type name)|`+INSTANCEOF+`|Used to check if the record extends a type|`+@this INSTANCEOF 'Customer' OR @type INSTANCEOF 'Provider'+`
|collection|`+IN+`|contains any of the elements listed|`+name IN ['European','Asiatic']+`
|collection|`+NOT IN+`|contains all of the elements not listed|`+name NOT IN ['European','Asiatic']+`
|collection|`+CONTAINS+`|true if the collection contains at least one element that satisfy the next condition. Use `+@this+` as right item for lists. Condition can be a single item: in this case the behaviour is like the `+IN+` operator|`+children CONTAINS (name = 'Luke')+` ; `+map.values() CONTAINS (name = 'Luke')+` ; `+['a','b'] CONTAINS (@this ILIKE 'A')+`
|collection|`+CONTAINSALL+`|true if all the elements of the left collection are contained in the right collection|`+children.name CONTAINSALL ['Luke','Leia']+`
|collection|`+CONTAINSANY+`|true if any the elements of the left collection is contained in the right collection|`+children.name CONTAINSANY ['Jacen','Jaina','Ben']+`
|map|`+CONTAINSKEY+`|true if the map contains at least one key equals to the requested. You can also use `+map.keys() CONTAINS+` in place of it|`+connections CONTAINSKEY 'Luke'+`
|map|`+CONTAINSVALUE+`|true if the map contains at least one value equals to the requested. You can also use `+map.values() CONTAINS+` in place of it|`+connections CONTAINSVALUE 10:3+`
|string|`+CONTAINSTEXT+`| When used against an indexed field, a lookup in the index will be performed with the text specified as key. When there is no index a simple Java `+indexOf+` will be performed. So the result set could be different if you have an index or not on that field |`+text CONTAINSTEXT 'jay'+`
|string|`+MATCHES+`|Matches the string using a http://www.regular-expressions.info/[Regular Expression]. Use the modifier `(?s)` to make `.` match also newlines.|`pass:[text MATCHES `\b[A-Z0-9.%+-]+@[A-Z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z]{2,4}\b`]`
|===

[discrete]

===== Logical Operators

[%header,cols=3]
|===
|Operator|Description|Example
|AND|true if both the conditions are true|`+name = 'Luke' AND surname LIKE 'Sky%'+`
|OR|true if at least one of the condition is true|`+name = 'Luke' OR surname LIKE 'Sky%'+`
|NOT|true if the condition is false. `+NOT+` needs parenthesis on the right with the condition to negate|`+NOT (name = 'Luke')+`
|===

[discrete]

===== Mathematics Operators

[%header,cols=4]
|===
|Apply to|Operator|Description|Example
|Numbers|+|Plus|`age + 34`
|Numbers|-|Minus|`salary - 34`
|Numbers|*|Multiply|`factor * 1.3`
|Numbers|/|Divide|`total / 12`
|Numbers|%|Mod|`total % 3`

===== Methods

Also called "Field Operators", are <<sql-methods,SQL-Methods>>.

==== Variables

ArcadeDB supports variables managed in the context of the command/query. By default, some variables are created. Below the table with the available variables:

[%header,cols=3]
|===
|Name |Description |Command(s)
|`+$parent+`|Get the parent context from a sub-query. Example: `+SELECT FROM V LET $type = (TRAVERSE * FROM $parent.$current.children)+` |<<sql-select,SELECT>> and <<sql-traverse,TRAVERSE>>
|`+$current+`|Current record to use in sub-queries to refer from the parent's variable|<<sql-select,SELECT>> and <<sql-traverse,TRAVERSE>>
|`+$depth+`|The current depth of nesting|<<sql-traverse,TRAVERSE>>
|`+$path+`|The string representation of the current path. Example: `+#6:0.in.#5:0#.out+`. You can also display it with `+SELECT $path FROM (TRAVERSE * FROM V)+`|<<sql-traverse,TRAVERSE>>
|`+$stack+`|The List of operation in the stack. Use it to access to the history of the traversal|<<sql-traverse,TRAVERSE>>
|`+$history+`|The set of all the records traversed as a `+Set<RID>+`|<<sql-traverse,TRAVERSE>>
|===

To set custom variable use the <<sql-script,LET>> keyword.

[discrete]

==== Wildcards

[%header,cols=3]
|===
|Symbol |Description |Example
|`+%+` |Matches all strings that contain an unknown substring of any length at the position of `+%+` |"%DB" "A%DB" "Arcade%" all match "ArcadeDB"
|`+?+` |Matches all strings that contain an unknown character at the position of `+?+` |"N?SQL" matches "NoSQL" but not "NewSQL"
|===

Filtering for strings containing wildcards characters can be done by escaping with backslash, i.e. `\%`, `\?`.
