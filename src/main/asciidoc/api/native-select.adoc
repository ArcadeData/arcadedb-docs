[[Native-Select]]
=== Native-Select

The native-select API is an alternative approach to query a database from Java.
This API combines an object-oriented syntax with SQL semantics and enables faster query processing than SQL.

Compare the following SQL and native-select queries:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT FROM mytype WHERE age > 20 AND name != 'Joe' ORDER BY age LIMIT 10;
----

[source,java]
----
database.select().fromType("mytype").where().property("age").ge().value(20).property("name").neq().value("Joe").orderBy("age").limit(10).compile();
----

Note that the projections happen after the query is compiled.

An important part of the query is the filtering.
Filtering in native-select is done by chaining compatible objects.
A filter is composed of a `SelectWhereLeftBlock`, `SelectWhereOperatorBlock`, and `SelectWhereRightBlock`.
Filters are chained or filtering is completed by the `SelectWhereAfterBlock`.

In the following tables are listed which group methods belonging to objects related to a native select query.
The columns of these tables list the method signature, consisting of name, arguments and return type,
a comment on its effect, and a corresponding SQL element.
