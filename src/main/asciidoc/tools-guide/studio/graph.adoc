==== Graph Panel

The Graph panel renders query results as an interactive graph visualization.
Vertices are displayed as nodes and edges as connections between them.

===== Graph Toolbar

The toolbar above the graph area provides the following actions:

* *Search* - Find nodes in the graph by property values
* *Redraw* - Re-render the graph layout
* *Select* - Selection tools:
** *Direct Neighbors* - Select nodes directly connected to the selected ones
** *Orphan Vertices* - Select nodes not connected to any other node
** *Invert Node Selection* - Invert the current selection
** *Shortest Path* - Find the shortest path between two selected nodes (Dijkstra algorithm)
* *Cut* - Remove selected nodes from the graph
* *Crop* - Keep only selected nodes and remove everything else
* *Import* - Import graph data (JSON, GraphML) or visual settings
* *Export* - Export graph data or visual settings
* *Settings* - Configure graph visualization preferences

===== Node Interaction

Click on a node to select it.
When a node is selected, its properties are displayed in the right panel.

The right panel shows:

- Element type: `Node` or `Edge`
- <<rid,Record ID (RID)>>
- Type
- Properties table
- Actions, containing quick actions to execute against the selected node
- Layout

The right panel can be hidden by clicking the `Hide Properties` button.

====== Node Layout

Click on the `+` button to expand and make visible the layout panel relative to the node type selected.

Change the label to an attribute that represents the node.
For example, selecting the title for the type `Movie` and the name for `Person` makes the graph much more readable.

You can save your settings in a file and share them with your colleagues.
To do this, click on `Export` button and select `Settings`, then download the file. You can re-apply the same style by selecting `Import` and then `Settings`.

===== Direct Neighbors

Selects the nodes directly connected to the selected ones.

*Usage*

Select one or more nodes from the graph and click on `Select -> Direct Neighbors`.

[discrete]
===== Orphan Vertices

Selects the nodes that are not connected with any other node.

*Usage*

Click on `Select -> Orphan Vertices`.

[discrete]
===== Invert Node Selection

Inverts the current selection.
All the elements that are currently selected will be not selected and all the elements that were not selected become selected.

*Usage*

Select some nodes from the graph and click on `Select -> Invert Node Selection`.

[discrete]
===== Shortest Path

Displays the shortest path between 2 nodes.
The Dijkstra algorithm is used (with fixed weight 1 per node).
If the two nodes are connected, the entire path will be selected.

*Usage*

Select 2 nodes from the graph and click on `Select -> Shortest Path`.
