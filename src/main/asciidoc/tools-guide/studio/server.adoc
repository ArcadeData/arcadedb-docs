* *Backup Directory* - Directory where backups are stored (relative to server root)
* *Run On Server* - In HA clusters, which server runs backups (`$leader` or `*`)

*Schedule*

* *Schedule Type* - Choose between frequency-based or CRON-based scheduling
* *Frequency* - Minutes between backups (when using frequency-based scheduling)
* *CRON Expression* - Cron expression for precise scheduling (when using CRON-based scheduling)
* *Time Window* - Optional time window to restrict when backups can run

*Retention Policy*

* *Max Backup Files* - Maximum number of backup files to keep per database
* *Use Tiered Retention* - Enable grandfathering backup rotation
