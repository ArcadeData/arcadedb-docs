There are several ways to create databases, where each has advantages in certain scenarios laid out next.

*Console*

The <<console,console>> tool provides a SQL-like statement which is not part of the general ArcadeDB SQL dialect (see <<sql,SQL overview>>).
Since console commands can be passed via command line, this way is useful when preparing a database via script, Dockerfile, or CI.

*Studio*

The <<studio,studio>> tool provides a GUI to create (and manage) databases.
This method is useful when experimenting or using an exploratory approach.
Under the hood, the studio uses the HTTP API.

*HTTP API*

The <<http-servercommand,HTTP `server` command>> can be used to create a database remotely.
This is useful, for example, when programmatically managing databases in containers or on virtual machines.

*Java API*

The <<factorycreate,`create` method>> of the `DatabaseFactory` class can be used when using ArcadeDB as an embedded database.

*Server Argument*

Lastly, the <<arcadedb-settings,`defaultDatabases` setting>> allows to implicitly create a database when starting the server, as a specified default database that does not exists is created.
