ArcadeDB indexes are built by using the LSM Tree algorithm.

==== LSM Tree algorithm

LSM tree is a type of data structure that is used to store and retrieve data efficiently.
It works by organizing data in a tree-like structure, where each node in the tree represents a certain range of data.

Here's how it works:

1. When you want to store a piece of data in the LSM tree, it first goes into a special part of the tree called a "write buffer." The write buffer is like a temporary storage area where new data is kept until it's ready to be added to the tree.

1. When the write buffer gets full, the LSM tree will "flush" the data from the write buffer into the main part of the tree.
This is done by creating a new node in the tree and adding the data from the write buffer to it.

1. As more and more data is added to the tree, it will eventually become too large to be stored in memory (this is known as "overflowing").
When this happens, the LSM tree will start to "compact" the data by moving some of it to disk storage.
This allows the tree to continue growing without running out of memory.

1. When you want to retrieve a piece of data from the LSM tree, the algorithm will search for it in the write buffer, the main part of the tree, and any data that has been compacted to disk storage.
If the data is found, it will be returned to you

==== LSM Tree vs B+Tree

B+Tree is the most common algorithm used by Relational DBMSs. What are the differences?

1. LSM tree and B+ tree are both data structures that are commonly used to store and retrieve data efficiently. Here are some of the main advantages of LSM tree over B+ tree:

1. LSM tree is more efficient for writes: LSM tree uses a write buffer to temporarily store new data, which allows it to batch writes and reduce the number of disk accesses required. This can make it faster than B+ tree for inserting large amounts of data.

1. LSM tree is more efficient for compaction: Because LSM tree stores data in a sorted fashion, it can compact data more efficiently by simply merging sorted data sets. B+ tree, on the other hand, requires more complex rebalancing operations when compacting data.

1. LSM tree is more space-efficient: LSM tree stores data in a compact, sorted format, which can make it more space-efficient than B+ tree. This can be especially useful when storing large amounts of data on disk.

1. However, there are also some potential disadvantages of LSM tree compared to B+ tree. For example, B+ tree may be faster for queries that require range scans or random access, and it may be easier to implement in some cases.
