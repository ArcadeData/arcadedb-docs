### Transactions
image:../images/edit.png[link="https://github.com/ArcadeData/arcadedb-docs/blob/main/src/main/asciidoc/concepts/transactions.adoc" float=right]

A transaction comprises a unit of work performed within a database management system (or similar system) against a database, and treated in a coherent and reliable way independent of other transactions.
Transactions in a database environment have two main purposes:

- to provide reliable units of work that allow correct recovery from failures and keep a database consistent even in cases of system failure, when execution stops (completely or partially) and many operations upon a database remain uncompleted, with unclear status 
- to provide isolation between programs accessing a database concurrently.
If this isolation is not provided, the program's outcome are possibly erroneous.

A database transaction, by definition, must be <<_-atomicity,atomic>>, [consistent](#consistency), [isolated](#isolation) and [durable](#durability).
Database practitioners often refer to these properties of database transactions using the acronym <<_-acid-properties,ACID>>).
--- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_transaction[Wikipedia]

ArcadeDB is an <<_-acid-properties,ACID>> compliant DBMS.

NOTE: ArcadeDB keeps the transaction on client RAM, so the transaction size is affected by the available RAM (Heap memory) on JVM.
For transactions involving many records, consider to split it in multiple transactions.

#### Atomicity

"Atomicity requires that each transaction is 'all or nothing': if one part of the transaction fails, the entire transaction fails, and the database state is left unchanged.
An atomic system must guarantee atomicity in each and every situation, including power failures, errors, and crashes.
To the outside world, a committed transaction appears (by its effects on the database) to be indivisible ("atomic"), and an aborted transaction does not happen." - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID[WikiPedia]

#### Consistency

"The consistency property ensures that any transaction will bring the database from one valid state to another.
Any data written to the database must be valid according to all defined rules, including but not limited to constraints, cascades, triggers, and any combination thereof.
This does not guarantee correctness of the transaction in all ways the application programmer might have wanted (that is the responsibility of application-level code) but merely that any programming errors do not violate any defined rules." - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID[WikiPedia]

ArcadeDB uses the MVCC to assure consistency by versioning the page where the record are stored.

Look at this example:

[%header,cols=4]
|===
|Sequence| Client/Thread 1 | Client/Thread 2 | Version of page containing record X
|1| Begin of Transaction |  |
|2| read(x)  |  | 10
|3|  | Begin of Transaction |
|4|  | read(x) | 10
|5|  |  write(x) | 10
|6|  |  commit | 10 -> 11
|7| write(x)  |  | 10
|8| commit |  | 10 -> 11 = Error, in database x already is at 11
|===

#### Isolation

"The isolation property ensures that the concurrent execution of transactions results in a system state that would be obtained if transactions were executed serially, i.e. one after the other.
Providing isolation is the main goal of concurrency control.
Depending on concurrency control method, the effects of an incomplete transaction might not even be visible to another transaction." - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID[WikiPedia]


Using `remote` access all the commands are executed on the server, so out of transaction scope.
Look below for more information.

Look at these examples:

[%header,cols=3]
|===
|Sequence| Client/Thread 1 | Client/Thread 2
|1| Begin of Transaction |
|2| read(x) |
|3|  | Begin of Transaction
|4|  | read(x)
|5|  |  write(x)
|6|  |  commit
|7| read(x)  |
|8| commit |
|===

At operation 7 the client 1 continues to read the same version of x read in operation 2.

[%header,cols=3]
|===
|Sequence| Client/Thread 1 | Client/Thread 2
|1| Begin of Transaction |
|2| read(x) |
|3|  | Begin of Transaction
|4|  | read(y)
|5|  |  write(y)
|6|  |  commit
|7| read(y)   |
|8| commit  |
|===

At operation 7 the client 1 reads the version of y which was written at operation 6 by client 2. This is because it never reads y before.

#### Durability

"Durability means that once a transaction has been committed, it will remain so, even in the event of power loss, crashes, or errors.
In a relational database, for instance, once a group of SQL statements execute, the results need to be stored permanently (even if the database crashes immediately thereafter).
To defend against power loss, transactions (or their effects) must be recorded in a non-volatile memory." - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID[WikiPedia]

[discrete]
##### Fail-over

An ArcadeDB instance can fail for several reasons:
- HW problems, such as loss of power or disk error - SW problems, such as a Operating System crash - Application problem, such as a bug that crashes your application that is connected to the Orient engine.

You can use the ArcadeDB engine directly in the same process of your application.
This gives superior performance due to the lack of inter-process communication.
In this case, should your application crash (for any reason), the ArcadeDB Engine also crashes.

If you're using an ArcadeDB Server connected remotely, if your application crashes the engine continue to work, but any pending transaction owned by the client will be rolled back.

[discrete]
##### Auto-recovery

At start-up the ArcadeDB Engine checks to if it is restarting from a crash.
In this case, the auto-recovery phase starts which rolls back all pending transactions.

ArcadeDB has different levels of durability based on storage type, configuration and settings.

[discrete]
#### Optimistic Transaction

This mode uses the well known [Multi Version Control System http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiversion_concurrency_control[MVCC] by allowing multiple reads and writes on the same records.
The integrity check is made on commit.
If the record has been saved by another transaction in the interim, then an OConcurrentModificationException will be thrown.
The application can choose either to repeat the transaction or abort it.

NOTE: ArcadeDB keeps the whole transaction on client's RAM, so the transaction size is affected by the available RAM (Heap) memory on JVM.
For transactions involving many records, consider to split it in multiple transactions.

[discrete]
#### Nested transactions and propagation

ArcadeDB does support nested transaction.
If further `begin()` are called after a transaction is already begun, then the new transaction is the current one until commit or rollback.
When the nested transaction is completed, the previous transaction becomes the current transaction.
