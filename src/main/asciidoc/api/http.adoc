==== Introduction

The ArcadeDB Server is accessible from the remote through the HTTP/JSON protocol.
The protocol is very simple.
For this reason, you don't need a driver, because every modern programming language provides an easy way to execute HTTP requests and parse JSON.

For the examples in this chapter we're going to use https://curl.se/[`curl`].
Every request must be authenticated by passing user and password as HTTP basic authentication (in HTTP Headers).
In the examples below we're going to always use "root" user with password "arcadedb-password".

NOTE: Under Windows (Powershell) single and double quotes inside a single or double quoted string need to be replaced with their Unicode entity representations `\u0022` (double quote) and
`\u0027` (single quote).
This is for example the case in the data argument (`-d`) of POST requests.

[discrete]
==== Server-Side Transactions

ArcadeDB implements server-side transaction over HTTP stateless protocol by using sessions.
A session is created with the <<http-begin,/begin>> request and returns a session id in the response header (example `arcadedb-session-id: AS-ee056170-dc9b-4956-8d71-d7cfa01900d4`).
Use the session id in the request header of further commands you want to execute in the same transaction and request <<http-commit,/commit>> to commit the server side transaction or <<http-rollback,/rollback>> to rollback the changes.
After a period of inactivity (default is 30 seconds, see <<settings-sql,`server.httpTxExpireTimeout`>>), the server automatically rolls back and purges expired transactions.

[discrete]
==== Transaction Scripts

In case <<sql,SQL>> (`sql`) is supposed to be used as language for a transactions, the language variant <<sql-script,SQL Script>> (`sqlscript`) is also available.
A `sqlscript` can consist of one or multiple SQL statements, which is collectively treated as a transaction.
Hence, for such a batch of SQL statements, no `begin` and `commit` commands are necessary, since `begin` and `commit` implicitly enclose any `sqlscript` command.

[[websocket-streaming]]
==== Streaming Change Events

IMPORTANT: This feature only works on the server where changes are executed.
In a replicated environment, the changes executed on other servers would not fire events on all the servers in the cluster, but only on the local server.
The cluster support is coming soon.

The Java API supports real-time change notifications, which the HTTP API implements via a websocket.
You can opt into notifications for all changes that occur on a database, or filter by the operation (i.e. create, update, delete) or underlying entity type.

To connect, point your favorite WebSocket client to the `ws://SERVER:PORT/ws` endpoint.
You will need to authenticate with HTTP Basic, which for some clients (like most browsers) is only possible via the URI, like this: `ws://USERNAME:PASSWORD@SERVER:PORT/ws`.
Others will require that you set the Authorization header directly.
Check the documentation for your client of choice for details.

To subscribe/unsubscribe to change events, send JSON messages using the following structure:

[cols="10h,10h,~",options="header"]
|===
|Property|Required|Description
|action|Required| `subscribe` or `unsubscribe`.
|database|Required| The database name.
|type|Optional| The entity type to filter by.
|changeTypes|Optional| Array of change types you'd like to receive. Must be `create`, `update`, or `delete`.
|===

Example: to subscribe to all changes (create, update, delete) for the type `Movie` in the database `movies`, use:

[source,json]
----
{"action": "subscribe", "database": "movies", "type": "Movie"}
----

If instead, you only want updates, send:

[source,json]
----
{"action": "subscribe", "database": "movies", "type": "Movie", "changeTypes": ["update"]}
----

If you want every change on the database (use with caution!):

[source,json]
----
{"action": "subscribe", "database": "movies"}
----

Once subscribed, you will get JSON messages for any matching changes with the following properties:

[cols="10h,~",options="header"]
|===
|Property|Description
|database| The source database.
|changeType| create, update or delete.
|record| The full record that generated the change event.
|===

==== Responses

The server answers a HTTP request with a response.
This response can have a body, which will always be in the JSON format.
Generally, a successful response (HTTP status codes 2xx) contains a `result` field, while an erroneous request (HTTP status code 4xx) has an `error` field, and a server error (HTTP status code 5xx), in addition to the `error` field, provides a `detail` and an `exception` field.

==== Tutorial

Let's first create an empty database "school" on the server:

[source,shell]
----
$ curl -X POST http://localhost:2480/api/v1/server \
       -d '{ "command": "create database school" }' \
       -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       --user root:arcadedb-password
----

Now let's create the type "Class":

[source,shell]
----
$ curl -X POST http://localhost:2480/api/v1/command/school \
       -d '{ "language": "sql", "command": "create document type Class"}' \
       -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       --user root:arcadedb-password
----

We could insert our first Class by using SQL:

[source,shell]
----
$ curl -X POST http://localhost:2480/api/v1/command/school \
       -d '{ "language": "sql", "command": "insert into Class set name = '\''English'\'', location =  '\''3rd floor'\''"}' \
       -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       --user root:arcadedb-password
----

Or better, using parameters with SQL:

[source,shell]
----
$ curl -X POST http://localhost:2480/api/v1/command/school \
       -d '{ "language": "sql", "command": "insert into Class set name = :name, location = :location", "params": { "name": "English", "location": "3rd floor" }}' \
       -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       --user root:arcadedb-password

[[http-executequery]]
===== Execute a query (GET|POST)

This command allows executing idempotent commands, like `SELECT` and `MATCH`:

URL Syntax GET: `/api/v1/query/{database}/{language}/{command}`

URL Syntax POST: `/api/v1/query/{database}`

Where:

- `database` is the database name
- `language` is the query language used.
is the query language used, between "sql", "sqlscript", "graphql", "cypher", "gremlin", "mongo" and any other language supported by ArcadeDB and available at runtime.
- `command` the command to execute in encoded format
- `params` (optional), is the map of parameters to pass to the query engine via the POST body, where parameters are introduced with a colon `:`.

When using the `GET` variant the query needs to be URL encoded.

NOTE: Due to security reasons (encoded) slashes `/` (`%2F`) which are used for divisions or block comments, cannot be used in queries via the GET method with the `query/` endpoint.

NOTE: Question marks (`?`) cause the server to stop reading the query string when sent via GET.
To use question marks (inside strings) one can use `format('%c',63)`; in this case make sure to replace all percent symbols (`%`) in the format string with `%%`.

These restrictions do not apply to the `POST` variant, where the `language` and `command`
are send in the body.

NOTE: Even though a `POST` method is used, the query in `command` has to be idempotent.

Responses:

* https://httpstatuses.io/200[`200`] OK
* https://httpstatuses.io/400[`400`] invalid language, invalid query
* https://httpstatuses.io/403[`403`] invalid credentials
* https://httpstatuses.io/400[`500`] database does not exist, cannot execute query

Example:

[source,shell]
----
$ curl -X GET http://localhost:2480/api/v1/query/school/sql/select%20from%20Class \
       --user root:arcadedb-password
----

The `query` endpoint may also be used via the POST method, which has no character restrictions such as `/` or `?`:

[source,shell]
----
$ curl -X POST http://localhost:2480/api/v1/query/school \
       -d '{ "language": "sql", "command": "select from Class" }' \
       -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       --user root:arcadedb-password
----

[discrete]
[[http-command]]
[[http-executecommand]]
===== Execute database command (POST)

Executes a non-idempotent command (as an implicit transaction).

URL Syntax: `/api/v1/command/{database}`

Where:

- `database` is the database name

Example to create the new document type "Class":

[source,shell]
----
$ curl -X POST http://localhost:2480/api/v1/command/school \
       -d '{ "language": "sql", "command": "create document type Class"}' \
       -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       --user root:arcadedb-password
----

The payload, as a JSON, accepts the following parameters:

- `language` is the query language used, between "sql", "sqlscript", "graphql", "cypher", "gremlin", "mongo" and any other language supported by ArcadeDB and available at runtime.
- `command` the command to execute in encoded format
- `awaitResponse` (optional) a boolean which is by default "true", if set to "false" the command will be executed asynchronously and only acknowledgement of receiving the command is responded.
The completion of the command is noted in the log, yet no results of the command can be returned.
- `limit` (optional) is the maximum number of results to return
- `params` (optional), is the map of parameters to pass to the query engine, where parameters are prefixed with a colon `:`.
- `retries` (optional), is the number of times the command (transaction) is retried.
- `serializer` (optional) specify the serializer used for the result:
** `graph`: returns a graph separating vertices from edges
** `record`: returns everything as records
** `studio`: by default it's like record but with additional metadata for vertex records, such as the number of outgoing edges in `@out` property and total incoming edges in `@in` property.
This serializer is used by <<studio,Studio>>.

NOTE: Asynchronous commands (using `"awaitResponse": false`) are queued, and their processing is configurable via <<setting-database,`async*` database settings>>.

Responses:

* https://httpstatuses.io/200[`200`] OK
* https://httpstatuses.io/200[`202`] Accepted
* https://httpstatuses.io/400[`400`] invalid language, invalid command
* https://httpstatuses.io/403[`403`] invalid credentials

[discrete]
[[http-begin]]
===== Begin a transaction (POST)

Begins a transaction on the server managed as a session.
The response header contains the session id.
Set this id in the following requests to execute them in the same transaction scope.
See also <<http-commit,/commit>> and <<http-rollback,/rollback>>.

URL Syntax: `/api/v1/begin/{database}`

Where:

- `database` is the database name

The payload, optional as a JSON, accepts the following parameters:

- `isolationLevel` is the isolation level for the current transaction, either `READ_COMMITTED` (default) or `REPEATABLE_READ`.

Responses:
