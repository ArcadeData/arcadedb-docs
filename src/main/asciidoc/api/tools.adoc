=== Compatible Tools

==== DBeaver

The universal database tool https://dbeaver.io[DBeaver] has basic compatibility via the legacy Postgres connector.
Create a new connection with the "PostgreSQL (Old)" driver:

Add your host, port, database, username and password to the general connection settings:

Set the `preferQueryMode` option to `simple` on "Driver Properties" tab:

Set the `sslmode` option to `disable`:

The "Finish" the connection wizard and double click the created connection to connect.
Then with a right-click the SQL console can be started:

Now the SQL console can be used to communicate via DBeaver with ArcadeDB.

Note that this is only a basic support using a generic relational driver for a NoSQL database,
so various functionalities can reslt in errors.

==== DbVisualizer

TODO

==== LibreOffice Base

There is minimal support for ArcadeDB in https://www.libreoffice.org/discover/base/[LibreOffice Base] via a PostgreSQL connection:

Select "Connect to existing database" and choose "PostgreSQL"

Enter the postgres protocol connection string (without username and password), for example:
`postgres://localhost:5432/dbname`

image::../images/libreoffice-settings.png[]

Enter the user name and check that a password is required (try with the "Test Connection" button)

Choose if you want to register the database in LibreOffice, select to open for editing, and "Finish" the wizard.

Now, in the menu under "Tools" -> "SQL..." queries and commands can be send to ArcadeDB.

Make sure that "Run SQL command directly" is selected, and to view results check "Show output  ..."
