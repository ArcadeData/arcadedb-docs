Click on any topic to open its documentation page.
* *Right panel* - A welcome area with the ArcadeDB logo, a brief description, and feature cards highlighting key capabilities:
** *Multi-Model* - Graph, Document, Key/Value, Search, Time Series, and Vector in one engine
** *Multi-Language* - SQL, Cypher, Gremlin, GraphQL, MongoDB QL, and Redis commands
** *Multi-Protocol* - HTTP/JSON, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Redis wire protocols
** *Performance* - Built for speed with minimal GC pressure and efficient storage
** *ACID Transactions* - Full transaction support with isolation and durability guarantees
** *High Availability* - Leader-follower replication with automatic failover

Quick links at the bottom provide access to the full documentation, GitHub repository, and community resources.
