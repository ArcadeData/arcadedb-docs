It's the entry point class that allows to create and open a database.
A `DatabaseFactory` object doesn't keep any state and its only goal is creating a <<database-url,Database>> instance.

Example:

```java
DatabaseFactory factory = new DatabaseFactory("/databases/mydb");
```

'''

[[factoryclose]]
====== close()

Close a database factory.
This method frees some resources, but it's not necessary to call it to unlock the databases.

Syntax:

```java
void close()
```

'''

[[factoryexists]]
====== exists()

Returns `true` if the database already exists, otherwise `false`.

Syntax:

```java
boolean exists()
```

'''

[[factorycreate]]
====== Database create()

Creates a new database.
If the database already exists, an exception is thrown.

Example:

```java
DatabaseFactory arcade = new DatabaseFactory("/databases/mydb");
Database db = arcade.create();
```

'''

[[factoryopen]]
====== Database open()

Opens an existent database in READ_WRITE mode.
If the database does not exist, an exception is thrown.

Example:

```java
DatabaseFactory arcade = new DatabaseFactory("/databases/mydb");
try( Database db = arcade.open(); ) {
  // YOUR CODE
}
```

'''

[[factoryopenmode]]
====== Database open(MODE mode)

Opens an existent database by specifying a mode between READ_WRITE and READ_ONLY mode.
If the database does not exist, an exception is thrown.
In READ_ONLY mode, any attempt to modify the database throws an exception.

Example:

```java
DatabaseFactory arcade = new DatabaseFactory("/databases/mydb");
Database db = arcade.open(MODE.READ_ONLY);
try {
  // YOUR CODE
} finally {
  db.close();
}
```
