[[Secuity-Policy]]
=== Security Policy

The default rule of security are pretty basic.
The password length must be between 8 and 256 characters.
You can implement your own security policy by providing your own implementation:

```
server.getSecurity().setCredentialsValidator( new CredentialsValidator(){
  @Override
  public void validateCredentials(final String userName, final String userPassword) throws ServerSecurityException {
  }

  @Override
  public String generateRandomPassword() {
  }
});
```
