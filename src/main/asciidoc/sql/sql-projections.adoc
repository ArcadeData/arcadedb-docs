=== Projections

A projection is a value that is returned by a query statement (SELECT, MATCH).

Eg. the following query

[source,sql]
----
SELECT name AS firstName, age * 12 AS ageInMonths, out("Friend")
FROM Person
WHERE surname = 'Smith'
----

has three projections:

* `name as firstName`
* `age * 12 as ageInMonths`
* `out(&quot;Friend&quot;)`

==== Syntax

A *projection* has the following syntax:

`&lt;expression&gt; [&lt;nestedProjection&gt;] [ AS &lt;alias&gt; ]`

* `&lt;expression&gt;` is an expression (see <<sql-L<<sql-L<<sql-Syntax,E,E,SQL Syntax>>) that represents the way to calculate the value of the single projection
* `&lt;alias&gt;` is the Identifier (see <<sql-L<<sql-L<<sql-Syntax,E,E,SQL Syntax>>) representing the field name used to return the value in the result set

A projection block has the following syntax:

`[DISTINCT] &lt;projection&gt; [, &lt;projection&gt; ]*`

* `DISTINCT`: removes duplicates from the result-set

[discrete]
==== Query result

By default, a query returns a different result-set based on the projections it has:

* *no projections*: The result set is made of records as they arrive from the target, with the original `@rid` and `@type` attributes (if any)
* `+*+` *alone*: same behavior as without `+*+` except the `hidden` property attribute is applied.
* `+*+` *plus other projections*: records of the original target, merged with the other projection values, with `@rid` and `@type` of the original record.
* `expand(&lt;projection&gt;)`: The result set is made of the records returned by the projection, expanded (if the projection result is a link or a collection of links) and unwinded (if the projection result is a collection). Nothing in all the other cases.
* *one or more projections*: temporary records (with temporary `@rid` and no `@type`). Projections that represent links are returned as simple @rid values, unless differently specified in the fetch plan.

IMPORTANT: Projection values can be overwritten in the final result, the overwrite happens from left to right.

eg.

[source,sql]
----
SELECT 1 AS a, 2 AS a 
----

will return `[{&quot;a&quot;:2}]`

eg.

Having the record `{&quot;@type&quot;:&quot;Foo&quot;, &quot;name&quot;:&quot;bar&quot;, &quot;@rid&quot;:&quot;#12:0&quot;}`

[source,sql]
----
SELECT *, "hey" AS name FROM Foo
----

will return `[{&quot;@type&quot;:&quot;Foo&quot;, &quot;@rid&quot;:&quot;#12:0&quot;, &quot;name&quot;:&quot;hey&quot;}]`

[source,sql]
----
SELECT  "hey" AS name, * FROM Foo
----

will return `[{&quot;@type&quot;:&quot;Foo&quot;, &quot;@rid&quot;:&quot;#12:0&quot;, &quot;name&quot;:&quot;bar&quot;}]`

IMPORTANT: When saving back a record with a valid rid, you will overwrite the existing record!
So pay attention when using `*` together with other projections.

IMPORTANT: The result of the query can be further unwound using the <<sql-L<<sql-Select-Unwind,E,`UNWIND`>> operator.

IMPORTANT: `expand()` cannot be used together with `GROUP BY`.

===== Aliases

The alias is the field name that a projection will have in the result-set.

An alias can be implicit, if declared with the `AS` keyword, eg.

[source,sql]
----
SELECT name + " " + surname AS full_name FROM Person
----

Result: `[{"full_name":"John Smith"}]`

An alias can be implicit, when no `AS` is defined, eg.

[source,sql]
----
SELECT name FROM Person
----

Result: `[{"name":"John"}]`

An implicit alias is calculated based on how the projection is written.
By default, ArcadeDB uses the plain string representation of the projection as alias.

[source,sql]
----
SELECT 1+2 AS sum
----

Result: `[{"sum": 3}]` 

[source,sql]
----
SELECT parent.name+" "+parent.surname AS full_name FROM Node
----

Result: `[{"full_name": "John Smith"}]`

The string representation of a projection is the exact representation of the projection string, without spaces before and after dots and brackets, no spaces before commands, a single space before and after operators.

eg.

[source,sql]
----
SELECT 1+2 
----

Result: `[{"1 + 2": 3}]`

Note the space before and after the plus symbol.

[source,sql]
----
SELECT parent.name+" "+parent.surname FROM Node
----

Result: `[{"parent.name + \" \" + parent.nurname": "John Smith"}]`

[source,sql]
----
SELECT items[4] from Node
----

Result: `[{"items[4]": "John Smith"}]`

==== Nested projections

*Syntax*:

`&quot;:{&quot; ( * | ([&quot;!&quot;] &lt;identifier&gt; [&quot;*&quot;] (&lt;comma&gt; [&quot;!&quot;] &lt;identifier&gt; [&quot;*&quot;])* ) ) &quot;}&quot;`

A projection can refer to a link or to a collection of links, eg. a LIST or MAP.
In some cases you can be interested in the expanded object instead of the RID.

Let's clarify this with an example. This is our dataset:

[%header,cols=4]
|===
| @rid | name | surname | parent
| #12:0 | foo | fooz |
| #12:1 | bar | barz | #12:0
| #12:2 | baz | bazz | #12:1
|===

Given this query:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT name, parent FROM TheType WHERE name = 'baz'
----

The result is
[source,json]
----
{ 
   "name": "baz",
   "parent": #12:1
}
----

Now suppose you want to expand the link and retrieve some properties of the linked object.
You can do it explicitly do it with other projections:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT name, parent.name FROM TheType WHERE name = 'baz'
----
[source,json]
----
{ 
   "name": "baz",
   "parent.name": "bar"
}
----

but this will force you to list them one by one, and it's not always possible, especially when you don't know all their names.

Another alternative is to use nested projections, eg.

[source,sql]
----
SELECT name, parent:{name} FROM TheType WHERE name = 'baz'
----

[source,json]
----
{ 
   "name": "baz",
   "parent": {
      "name": "bar"
   }
}
----

or with multiple attributes

[source,sql]
----
SELECT name, parent:{name, surname} FROM TheType WHERE name = 'baz'
----

[source,json]
----
{ 
   "name": "baz",
   "parent": {
      "name": "bar"
      "surname": "barz"      
   }
}
----

or using a wildcard

[source,sql]
----
SELECT name, parent:{*} FROM TheType WHERE name = 'baz'
----

[source,json]
----
{ 
   "name": "baz",
   "parent": {
      "name": "bar"
      "surname": "barz"      
      "parent": #12:0
   }
}
----

You can also use the `!` exclude syntax to define which attributes you want to _exclude_ from the nested projection:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT name, parent:{!surname} FROM TheType WHERE name = 'baz'
----

[source,json]
----
{ 
   "name": "baz",
   "parent": {
      "name": "bar"
      "parent": #12:0
   }
}
----

You can also use a wildcard on the right of property names, to specify the inclusion of attributes that start with a prefix, eg.

[source,sql]
----
SELECT name, parent:{surna*} FROM TheType WHERE name = 'baz'
----

[source,json]
----
{ 
   "name": "baz",
   "parent": {
      "surname": "barz"      
   }
}
----

or their exclusion

[source,sql]
----
SELECT name, parent:{!surna*} FROM TheType WHERE name = 'baz'
----

[source,json]
----
{ 
   "name": "baz",
   "parent": {
      "name": "bar",      
      "parent": #12:0
   }
}
----

Nested projection syntax allows for multiple level depth expressions, eg. you can go three levels deep as follows:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT name, parent:{name, surname, parent:{name, surname}} FROM TheType WHERE name = 'baz'
----

[source,json]
----
{ 
   "name": "baz",
   "parent": {
      "name": "bar"
      "surname": "barz"      
      "parent": {
         "name": "foo"
         "surname": "fooz"      
      }   
   }
}
----

You can also use expressions and aliases in nested projections:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT name, parent.parent:{name, surname} as grandparent FROM TheType WHERE name = 'baz'
----

[source,json]
----
{ 
   "name": "baz",
   "grandparent": {
      "name": "foo"
      "surname": "fooz"      
   }   
}
----

Finally, you can rename fields with `AS`:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT name, parent.parent:{name AS givenname} as grandparent FROM TheType WHERE name = 'baz'
----

[source,json]
----
{ 
   "name": "baz",
   "grandparent": {
      "givenname": "fooz"      
   }   
}
----
