=== Security Policy

The default rules of security are pretty basic.
The username must be between 4 and 256 characters.
The password length must be between 8 and 256 characters.
You can implement your own security policy by providing your own implementation:

[source,java]
----
server.getSecurity().setCredentialsValidator( new DefaultCredentialsValidator(){
  @Override
  public void validateCredentials(final String userName, final String userPassword) throws ServerSecurityException {
    if( userPassword.equals("12345678")
      throw new ServerSecurityException("Guess who was not attending security lesson!");
  }
});
----
