==== Frequently Asked Questions

* How do I build or contribute to ArcadeDB?
** See the contributing guide in the ArcadeDB https://github.com/ArcadeData/arcadedb[github] repository: https://github.com/ArcadeData/arcadedb/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md[CONTRIBUTING.md]

* How do I protect prepared statements against SQL injection?
** A good starting point is the https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/SQL_Injection_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html[OWASP SQL Injection Prevention Cheat Sheet].
   To use escaping as defense, the characters `\`, `"`, `'`, need to be escaped with `\\`, `\"`, `\'` respectively. Furthermore, the strings `;` and `--` need to be replaced,
   for example with similar unicode characters like `;` (greek question mark, `\u037E`) and `–` (en dash, `\u2013`). Please note, that this escaping and replacing is merely a minimal protection, and generally not sufficient.
