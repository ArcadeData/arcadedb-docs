=== Backup of a Database

ArcadeDB allows to execute a non-stop backup of a database while it is used without blocking writes or affecting performance.
You can execute the backup of a database from SQL.

Look at <<sql-backup-database,Backup Database SQL command>> for more information.

==== Cloud Backups

In a container setting it may become necessary to send backups to an S3 bucket instead of a mounted volume.
Currently, ArcadeDB does not support writing a backup to S3 directly, but there are two ways of achieving this:

1. Using an intermediary container which forwards a volume's contents to an S3 bucket.
   The project https://github.com/elementar/docker-s3-volume[docker-s3-volume] makes this easy.

2. Mounting an S3 bucket inside the ArcadeDB container directly with the https://github.com/s3fs-fuse/s3fs-fuse[S3 file system via filesystem in userspace].
