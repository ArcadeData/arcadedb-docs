=== What is ArcadeDB?

ArcadeDB is the new generation of DBMS (DataBase Management System) that runs pretty much on every hardware/software configuration.
ArcadeDB is multi-model, which means it can work with graphs, documents as well as other models of data,
and doing so extremely fast.

==== How can it be so fast?

ArcadeDB is written in LLJ ("Low-Level-Java"), that means it's written in Java (Java8+), but without using a high-level API.
The result is that ArcadeDB does not allocate many objects at run-time on the heap, so the garbage collection does not need to act regularly, only rarely.
At the same time, it is highly portable and leverages the hyper optimized Java Virtual Machine*.
Furthermore, the kernel is built to be efficient on multi-core CPUs by using novel mechanical sympathy techniques.

ArcadeDB is a native graph database:

- No more "Joins": relationships are physical links to records
- Traverses parts of, or entire trees and graphs of records in milliseconds
- Traversing speed is independent from the database size

==== Cloud DBMS

ArcadeDB was born in the cloud.
Even though you can run ArcadeDB as <<embedded-server,embedded>> and in an on-premise setup, you can spin an ArcadeDB server/cluster in a few seconds with Docker, Kubernetes, Amazon AWS (coming soon), or Microsoft Azure (coming soon).

==== Is ArcadeDB FREE?

ArcadeDB Community Edition is really FREE for any purpose and thus released under the https://spdx.org/licenses/Apache-2.0.html[Apache 2.0 license].
We love to know about your project with ArcadeDB and any contributions back to ArcadeDB's open community (reports, patches, test cases, documentations, etc) are welcome.

Ask yourself: which is more likely to have better quality?
A DBMS created and tested by a handful of developers in isolation, or one tested by thousands of developers globally?
When code is public, everyone can scrutinize, test, report and resolve issues.
All things open source moves faster compared to the proprietary world.
